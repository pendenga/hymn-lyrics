# hymn-lyrics
Lyrics for popular hymns, organized for processing.

## Structure
The lyrics are organized in a directory structure based on hymnals and hymn numbers. Each hymnal has its own folder, 
and within each folder, each hymn is stored as a separate text file named with its hymn number.

A manifest file is included in each hymnal folder for each language, listing all hymns contained within that hymnal.
This should be limited to the page number and permalinks for each hymn in this repo, and a web link where apps could
be directed for users to read the full lyrics online, potentially with sheet music. 

## Encoding
All text files are encoded in UTF-8 to ensure compatibility with various characters and symbols used in hymn lyrics.
If the songs contain special characters, such as non-English, they are represented using Unicode escape sequences.

All rights are reserved by the original copyright holders. 
Attribution must be given to the original authors and publishers when using these lyrics.
