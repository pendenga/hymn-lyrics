  lines:
  - In our lovely Deseret,
  - Where the Saints of God have met,
  - There’s a multitude of children all around.
  - They are generous and brave;
  - They have precious souls to save;
  - They must listen and obey the gospel’s sound.
  - Hark! Hark! Hark! ’tis children’s music—
  - Children’s voices, oh, how sweet,
  - When in innocence and love,
  - Like the angels up above,
  - They with happy hearts and cheerful faces meet.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - That the children may live long
  - And be beautiful and strong,
  - Tea and coffee and tobacco they despise,
  - Drink no liquor, and they eat
  - But a very little meat;
  - They are seeking to be great and good and wise.
  - Hark! Hark! Hark! ’tis children’s music—
  - Children’s voices, oh, how sweet,
  - When in innocence and love,
  - Like the angels up above,
  - They with happy hearts and cheerful faces meet.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - They should be instructed young
  - How to watch and guard the tongue,
  - And their tempers train and evil passions bind;
  - They should always be polite,
  - And treat ev’rybody right,
  - And in ev’ry place be affable and kind.
  - Hark! Hark! Hark! ’tis children’s music—
  - Children’s voices, oh, how sweet,
  - When in innocence and love,
  - Like the angels up above,
  - They with happy hearts and cheerful faces meet.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - They must not forget to pray,
  - Night and morning ev’ry day,
  - For the Lord to keep them safe from ev’ry ill,
  - And assist them to do right,
  - That with all their mind and might
  - They may love him and may learn to do his will.
  - Hark! Hark! Hark! ’tis children’s music—
  - Children’s voices, oh, how sweet,
  - When in innocence and love,
  - Like the angels up above,
  - They with happy hearts and cheerful faces meet.
