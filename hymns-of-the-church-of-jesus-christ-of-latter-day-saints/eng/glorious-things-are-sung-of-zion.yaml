verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Glorious things are sung of Zion,
  - Enoch’s city seen of old,
  - Where the righteous, being perfect,
  - Walked with God in streets of gold.
  - Love and virtue, faith and wisdom,
  - Grace and gifts were all combined.
  - As himself each loved his neighbor;
  - All were one in heart and mind.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - There they shunn’d the pow’r of Satan
  - And observed celestial laws;
  - For in Adam-ondi-Ahman
  - Zion rose where Eden was.
  - When beyond the pow’r of evil,
  - So that none could covet wealth,
  - One continual feast of blessings
  - Crown’d their days with peace and health.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Then the tow’rs of Zion glittered
  - Like the sun in yonder skies,
  - And the wicked stood and trembled,
  - Filled with wonder and surprise.
  - Then their faith and works were perfect;
  - Lo, they followed their great Head!
  - So the city went to heaven,
  - And the world said, “Zion’s fled!”
- number: 4
  lines:
  - When the Lord returns with Zion,
  - And we hear the watchman cry,
  - Then we’ll surely be united,
  - And we’ll all see eye to eye.
  - Then we’ll mingle with the angels,
  - And the Lord will bless his own.
  - Then the earth will be as Eden,
  - And we’ll know as we are known.
