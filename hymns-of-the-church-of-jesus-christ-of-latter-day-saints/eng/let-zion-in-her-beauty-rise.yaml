title: Let Zion in Her Beauty Rise
marking: Boldly
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Let Zion in her beauty rise;
  - Her light begins to shine.
  - Ere long her King will rend the skies,
  - Majestic and divine,
  - The gospel spreading thru the land,
  - A people to prepare
  - To meet the Lord and Enoch’s band
  - Triumphant in the air.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Ye heralds, sound the golden trump
  - To earth’s remotest bound.
  - Go spread the news from pole to pole
  - In all the nations round:
  - That Jesus in the clouds above,
  - With hosts of angels too,
  - Will soon appear, his Saints to save,
  - His enemies subdue.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - That glorious rest will then commence
  - Which prophets did foretell,
  - When Saints will reign with Christ on earth,
  - And in his presence dwell
  - A thousand years, oh, glorious day!
  - Dear Lord, prepare my heart
  - To stand with thee on Zion’s mount
  - And nevermore to part.
