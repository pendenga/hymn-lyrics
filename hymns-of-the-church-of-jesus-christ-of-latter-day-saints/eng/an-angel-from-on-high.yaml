  - The long, long silence broke;

  - These gracious words he spoke:
  - Lo! in Cumorah’s lonely hill
  - A sacred record lies concealed.

  - A sacred record lies concealed.

  - Sealed by Moroni’s hand,
  - It has for ages lain
  - To wait the Lord’s command,
  - From dust to speak again.
  - It shall again to light come forth
  - To usher in Christ’s reign on earth.

  - It speaks of Joseph’s seed
  - And makes the remnant known
  - Of nations long since dead,
  - Who once had dwelt alone.

  - The time is now fulfilled,
  - The long-expected day;
  - Let earth obedience yield
  - And darkness flee away.

  - Its light and glory to the world.

  - Shall now be gathered home,
  - Their wealth and means employ
  - To build Jerusalem,
  - While Zion shall arise and shine
  - And fill the earth with truth divine.
  - While Zion shall arise and shine
  - And fill the earth with truth divine.
