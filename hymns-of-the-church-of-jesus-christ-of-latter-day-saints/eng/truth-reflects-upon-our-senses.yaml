title: Truth Reflects upon Our Senses
marking: Thoughtfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Truth reflects upon our senses;
  - Gospel light reveals to some.
  - If there still should be offenses,
  - Woe to them by whom they come!
  - Judge not, that ye be not judged,
  - Was the counsel Jesus gave;
  - Measure given, large or grudged,
  - Just the same you must receive.
  - Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us,
  - Till we reach that blissful shore
  - Where the angels wait to join us
  - In thy praise forevermore.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Jesus said, “Be meek and lowly,”
  - For ’tis high to be a judge;
  - If I would be pure and holy,
  - I must love without a grudge.
  - It requires a constant labor
  - All his precepts to obey.
  - If I truly love my neighbor,
  - I am in the narrow way.
  - Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us,
  - Till we reach that blissful shore
  - Where the angels wait to join us
  - In thy praise forevermore.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Once I said unto another,
  - “In thine eye there is a mote;
  - If thou art a friend, a brother,
  - Hold, and let me pull it out.”
  - But I could not see it fairly,
  - For my sight was very dim.
  - When I came to search more clearly,
  - In mine eye there was a beam.
  - Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us,
  - Till we reach that blissful shore
  - Where the angels wait to join us
  - In thy praise forevermore.
- number: 4
  optional: true
  lines:
  - If I love my brother dearer,
  - And his mote I would erase,
  - Then the light should shine the clearer,
  - For the eye’s a tender place.
  - Others I have oft reproved
  - For an object like a mote;
  - Now I wish this beam removed;
  - Oh, that tears would wash it out!
  - Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us,
  - Till we reach that blissful shore
  - Where the angels wait to join us
  - In thy praise forevermore.
- number: 5
  optional: true
  lines:
  - Charity and love are healing;
  - These will give the clearest sight;
  - When I saw my brother’s failing,
  - I was not exactly right.
  - Now I’ll take no further trouble;
  - Jesus’ love is all my theme;
  - Little motes are but a bubble
  - When I think upon the beam.
  - Blessed Savior, thou wilt guide us,
  - Till we reach that blissful shore
  - Where the angels wait to join us
  - In thy praise forevermore.
