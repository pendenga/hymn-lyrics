marking: With contemplation
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - If you could hie to Kolob
  - In the twinkling of an eye,
  - And then continue onward
  - With that same speed to fly,
  - Do you think that you could ever,
  - Through all eternity,
  - Find out the generation
  - Where Gods began to be?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Or see the grand beginning,
  - Where space did not extend?
  - Or view the last creation,
  - Where Gods and matter end?
  - Methinks the Spirit whispers,
  - “No man has found ‘pure space,’
  - Nor seen the outside curtains,
  - Where nothing has a place.”
- number: 3
  lines:
  - The works of God continue,
  - And worlds and lives abound;
  - Improvement and progression
  - Have one eternal round.
  - There is no end to matter;
  - There is no end to space;
  - There is no end to spirit;
  - There is no end to race.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - There is no end to virtue;
  - There is no end to might;
  - There is no end to wisdom;
  - There is no end to light.
  - There is no end to union;
  - There is no end to youth;
  - There is no end to priesthood;
  - There is no end to truth.
- number: 5
  lines:
  - There is no end to glory;
  - There is no end to love;
  - There is no end to being;
  - There is no death above.
  - There is no end to glory;
  - There is no end to love;
  - There is no end to being;
  - There is no death above.
