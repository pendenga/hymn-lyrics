verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - It may not be on the mountain height
  - Or over the stormy sea,
  - It may not be at the battle’s front
  - My Lord will have need of me.
  - But if, by a still, small voice he calls
  - To paths that I do not know,
  - I’ll answer, dear Lord, with my hand in thine:
  - I’ll go where you want me to go.
  - I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
  - Over mountain or plain or sea;
  - I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;
  - I’ll be what you want me to be.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Perhaps today there are loving words
  - Which Jesus would have me speak;
  - There may be now in the paths of sin
  - Some wand’rer whom I should seek.
  - O Savior, if thou wilt be my guide,
  - Tho dark and rugged the way,
  - My voice shall echo the message sweet:
  - I’ll say what you want me to say.
  - I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
  - Over mountain or plain or sea;
  - I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;
  - I’ll be what you want me to be.

  lines:
  - There’s surely somewhere a lowly place
  - In earth’s harvest fields so wide
  - Where I may labor through life’s short day
  - For Jesus, the Crucified.
  - So trusting my all to thy tender care,
  - And knowing thou lovest me,
  - I’ll do thy will with a heart sincere:
  - I’ll be what you want me to be.
  - I’ll go where you want me to go, dear Lord,
  - Over mountain or plain or sea;
  - I’ll say what you want me to say, dear Lord;
  - I’ll be what you want me to be.
