  lines:
  - From homes of Saints glad songs arise,
  - For there the Lord is King.
  - There faith is learned and prayers ascend,
  - The Spirit’s peace to bring.
  - For homes where scriptures old are loved,
  - And living prophets, too,
  - All thanks we give; the Father praise
  - For guidance sure and true.

  lines:
  - God’s truths protect the hearth from wrong
  - When error’s ways allure,
  - Lift minds from self to nobleness,
  - Keep thought and action pure.
  - Then sing, O Saints, in hymns of praise;
  - Sing thanks to God on high,
  - Whose counsels kept in homes on earth
  - Bring heaven’s glory nigh.
