title: The Wintry Day Descending to Its Close
marking: Expressively
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - The wintry day, descending to its close,
  - Invites all wearied nature to repose,
  - And shades of night are falling dense and fast,
  - Like sable curtains closing o’er the past.
  - Pale through the gloom the newly fallen snow
  - Wraps in a shroud the silent earth below
  - As tho ’twere mercy’s hand had spread the pall,
  - A symbol of forgiveness unto all.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - I cannot go to rest, but linger still
  - In meditation at my windowsill,
  - While, like the twinkling stars in heaven’s dome,
  - Come one by one sweet memories of home.
  - And wouldst thou ask me where my fancy roves
  - To reproduce the happy scenes it loves,
  - Where hope and memory together dwell
  - And paint the pictured beauties that I tell?
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Away beyond the prairies of the West,
  - Where exiled Saints in solitude were blest,
  - Where industry the seal of wealth has set
  - Amid the peaceful vales of Deseret,
  - Unheeding still the fiercest blasts that blow,
  - With tops encrusted by eternal snow,
  - The tow’ring peaks that shield the tender sod
  - Stand, types of freedom reared by nature’s God.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - The wilderness, that naught before would yield,
  - Is now become a fertile, fruitful field.
  - Where roamed at will the fearless Indian band,
  - The templed cities of the Saints now stand.
  - And sweet religion in its purity
  - Invites all men to its security.
  - There is my home, the spot I love so well,
  - Whose worth and beauty pen nor tongue can tell.
