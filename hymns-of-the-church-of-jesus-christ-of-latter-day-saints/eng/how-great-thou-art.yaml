  - Oh Lord, my God, when I, in awesome wonder
  - Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made
  - I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
  - Thy power throughout the universe displayed
  - Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
  - How great Thou art, how great Thou art
  - Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
  - How great Thou art, how great Thou art

  lines:
  - And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
  - Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
  - That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
  - He bled and died to take away my sin
  - Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
  - How great Thou art, how great Thou art
  - Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
  - How great Thou art, how great Thou art

  lines:
  - When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
  - And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
  - Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
  - And then proclaim, my God, how great Thou art
  - Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
  - How great Thou art, how great Thou art
  - Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
  - How great Thou art, how great Thou art
