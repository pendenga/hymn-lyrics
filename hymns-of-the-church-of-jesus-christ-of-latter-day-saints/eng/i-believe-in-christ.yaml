  - I believe in Christ; he is my King!
  - With all my heart to him I’ll sing;
  - I’ll raise my voice in praise and joy,
  - In grand amens my tongue employ.
  - I believe in Christ; he is God’s Son.
  - On earth to dwell his soul did come.
  - He healed the sick; the dead he raised.
  - Good works were his; his name be praised.

  lines:
  - I believe in Christ; oh blessed name!
  - As Mary’s Son he came to reign
  - ’Mid mortal men, his earthly kin,
  - To save them from the woes of sin.
  - I believe in Christ, who marked the path,
  - Who did gain all his Father hath,
  - Who said to men: “Come, follow me,
  - That ye, my friends, with God may be.”

  lines:
  - I believe in Christ—my Lord, my God!
  - My feet he plants on gospel sod.
  - I’ll worship him with all my might;
  - He is the source of truth and light.
  - I believe in Christ; he ransoms me.
  - From Satan’s grasp he sets me free,
  - And I shall live with joy and love
  - In his eternal courts above.

  lines:
  - I believe in Christ; he stands supreme!
  - From him I’ll gain my fondest dream;
  - And while I strive through grief and pain,
  - His voice is heard: “Ye shall obtain.”
  - I believe in Christ; so come what may,
  - With him I’ll stand in that great day
  - When on this earth he comes again
  - To rule among the sons of men.
