  - He is risen! He is risen!

  - Christ has won the victory.

  lines:
  - Come with high and holy hymning;
  - Chant our Lord’s triumphant lay.
  - Not one darksome cloud is dimming
  - Yonder glorious morning ray,
  - Breaking o’er the purple east,
  - Symbol of our Easter feast.

  lines:
  - He is risen! He is risen!
  - He hath opened heaven’s gate.
  - We are free from sin’s dark prison,
  - Risen to a holier state.
  - And a brighter Easter beam
  - On our longing eyes shall stream.
