title: Should You Feel Inclined to Censure
marking: Thoughtfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Should you feel inclined to censure
  - Faults you may in others view,
  - Ask your own heart, ere you venture,
  - If you have not failings, too.
  - Let not friendly vows be broken;
  - Rather strive a friend to gain.
  - Many words in anger spoken
  - Find their passage home again.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Do not, then, in idle pleasure
  - Trifle with a brother’s fame;
  - Guard it as a valued treasure,
  - Sacred as your own good name.
  - Do not form opinions blindly;
  - Hastiness to trouble tends;
  - Those of whom we thought unkindly
  - Oft become our warmest friends.
