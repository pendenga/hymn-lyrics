  - Beautiful Zion, built above;
  - Beautiful city that I love;
  - Beautiful gates of pearly white;
  - Beautiful temple—God its light;
  - He who was slain on Calvary
  - Opens those pearly gates for me.
  - Zion, Zion, lovely Zion;
  - Beautiful Zion;
  - Zion, city of our God!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Beautiful heav’n, where all is light;
  - Beautiful angels clothed in white;
  - Beautiful strains that never tire;
  - Beautiful harps thru all the choir;
  - There shall I join the chorus sweet,
  - Worshiping at the Savior’s feet.
  - Zion, Zion, lovely Zion;
  - Beautiful Zion;
  - Zion, city of our God!
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Beautiful crowns on ev’ry brow;
  - Beautiful palms the conq’rors show;
  - Beautiful robes the ransomed wear;
  - Beautiful all who enter there;
  - Thither I press with eager feet;
  - There shall my rest be long and sweet.
  - Zion, Zion, lovely Zion;
  - Beautiful Zion;
  - Zion, city of our God!
