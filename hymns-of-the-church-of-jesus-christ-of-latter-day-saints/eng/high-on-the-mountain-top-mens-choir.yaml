- number: 1
  lines:
  - High on the mountain top, a banner is unfurled.
  - Ye nations, now look up; It waves to all the world.
  - In Deseret’s sweet, peaceful land,
  - On Zion’s mount behold it stand!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - For God remembers still, his promise made of old
  - That he on Zion’s hill, truth’s standard would unfold!
  - Her light should there attract the gaze
  - Of all the world in latter days.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - His house shall there be reared, his glory to display,
  - And people shall be heard in distant lands to say:
  - We’ll now go up and serve the Lord,
  - Obey his truth and learn his word.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - For there we shall be taught, the law that will go forth,
  - With truth and wisdom fraught, to govern all the earth.
  - Forever there his ways we’ll tread,
  - And save ourselves with all our dead.
