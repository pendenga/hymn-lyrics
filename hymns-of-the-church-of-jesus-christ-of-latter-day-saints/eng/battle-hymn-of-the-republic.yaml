  - Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;
  - He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.
  - He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible, swift sword;
  - His truth is marching on.
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - His truth is marching on.

  lines:
  - He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;
  - He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment seat.
  - Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer him; be jubilant my feet!
  - Our God is marching on.
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - His truth is marching on.

  lines:
  - In the beauty of the lilies, Christ was born across the sea,
  - With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me.
  - As he died to make men holy, let us live to make men free,
  - While God is marching on.
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  - His truth is marching on.
