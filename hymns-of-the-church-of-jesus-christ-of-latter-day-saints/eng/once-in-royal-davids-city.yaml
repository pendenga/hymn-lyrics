  lines:
  - Once in royal David’s city
  - Stood a lowly cattle shed,
  - Where a mother laid her baby
  - In a manger for his bed:
  - Mary was that mother mild,
  - Jesus Christ her little child.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - He came down to earth from heaven,
  - Who is God and Lord of all,
  - And his shelter was a stable,
  - And his cradle was a stall;
  - With the poor, and mean, and lowly,
  - Lived on earth our Savior holy.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - And our eyes at last shall see him,
  - Through his own redeeming love;
  - For that child so dear and gentle
  - Is our Lord in heav’n above,
  - And he leads his children on
  - To the place where he is gone.
