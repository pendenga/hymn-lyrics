verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
  - Confused at the grace that so fully he proffers me.
  - I tremble to know that for me he was crucified,
  - That for me, a sinner, he suffered, he bled and died.
  - Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me
  - Enough to die for me!
  - Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine
  - To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,
  - That he should extend his great love unto such as I,
  - Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.
  - Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me
  - Enough to die for me!
  - Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!
- number: 3
  lines:
  - I think of his hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!
  - Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
  - No, no, I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
  - Until at the glorified throne I kneel at his feet.
  - Oh, it is wonderful that he should care for me
  - Enough to die for me!
  - Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!
