  lines:
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win,
  - To lead us to virtue and keep us from sin;
  - Most men can be led, but few can be driv’n
  - In shunning perdition and striving for heav’n.
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win
  - In leading to virtue and keeping from sin;
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win
  - In leading to virtue and keeping from sin.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - “Come to me, come to me” sweetly falls on the ear,
  - The word of the Lord full of comfort and cheer,
  - To bind up the broken, the captive set free,
  - In the good time that’s coming, we hope soon to see.
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win
  - In leading to virtue and keeping from sin;
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win
  - In leading to virtue and keeping from sin.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Let us govern by kindness and never by force,
  - All cheering and bright, like the sun in its course;
  - Obedience will spring from each heart with a bound,
  - And brotherhood flourish the wide world around.
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win
  - In leading to virtue and keeping from sin;
  - “Come along, come along” is the call that will win
  - In leading to virtue and keeping from sin.
