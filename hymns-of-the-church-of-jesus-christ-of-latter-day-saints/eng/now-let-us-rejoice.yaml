verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Now let us rejoice in the day of salvation.
  - No longer as strangers on earth need we roam.
  - Good tidings are sounding to us and each nation,
  - And shortly the hour of redemption will come,
  - When all that was promised the Saints will be given,
  - And none will molest them from morn until ev’n,
  - And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,
  - And Jesus will say to all Israel, “Come home.”
- number: 2
  lines:
  - We’ll love one another and never dissemble
  - But cease to do evil and ever be one.
  - And when the ungodly are fearing and tremble,
  - We’ll watch for the day when the Savior will come,
  - When all that was promised the Saints will be given,
  - And none will molest them from morn until ev’n,
  - And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,
  - And Jesus will say to all Israel, “Come home.”
- number: 3
  lines:
  - In faith we’ll rely on the arm of Jehovah
  - To guide thru these last days of trouble and gloom,
  - And after the scourges and harvest are over,
  - We’ll rise with the just when the Savior doth come.
  - Then all that was promised the Saints will be given,
  - And they will be crown’d with the angels of heav’n,
  - And earth will appear as the Garden of Eden,
  - And Christ and his people will ever be one.
