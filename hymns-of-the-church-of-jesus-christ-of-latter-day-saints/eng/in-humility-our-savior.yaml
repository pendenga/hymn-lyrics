  - In humility, our Savior,
  - Grant thy Spirit here, we pray,
  - As we bless the bread and water
  - In thy name this holy day.
  - Let me not forget, O Savior,
  - Thou didst bleed and die for me
  - When thy heart was stilled and broken
  - On the cross at Calvary.

  lines:
  - Fill our hearts with sweet forgiving;
  - Teach us tolerance and love.
  - Let our prayers find access to thee
  - In thy holy courts above.
  - Then, when we have proven worthy
  - Of thy sacrifice divine,
  - Lord, let us regain thy presence;
  - Let thy glory round us shine.
