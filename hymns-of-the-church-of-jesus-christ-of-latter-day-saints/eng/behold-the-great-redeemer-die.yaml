marking: Reverently
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Behold the great Redeemer die,
  - A broken law to satisfy.
  - He dies a sacrifice for sin,
  - He dies a sacrifice for sin,
  - That man may live and glory win.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - While guilty men his pains deride,
  - They pierce his hands and feet and side;
  - And with insulting scoffs and scorns,
  - And with insulting scoffs and scorns,
  - They crown his head with plaited thorns.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Although in agony he hung,
  - No murm’ring word escaped his tongue.
  - His high commission to fulfill,
  - His high commission to fulfill,
  - He magnified his Father’s will.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - “Father, from me remove this cup.
  - Yet, if thou wilt, I’ll drink it up.
  - I’ve done the work thou gavest me,
  - I’ve done the work thou gavest me;
  - Receive my spirit unto thee.”
- number: 5
  lines:
  - He died, and at the awful sight
  - The sun in shame withdrew its light!
  - Earth trembled, and all nature sighed,
  - Earth trembled, and all nature sighed
  - In dread response, “A God has died!”
- number: 6
  lines:
  - He lives—he lives. We humbly now
  - Around these sacred symbols bow
  - And seek, as Saints of latter days,
  - And seek, as Saints of latter days,
  - To do his will and live his praise.
