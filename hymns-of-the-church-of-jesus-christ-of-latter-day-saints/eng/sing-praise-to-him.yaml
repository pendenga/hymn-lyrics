  - Sing praise to him who reigns above,
  - The Lord of all creation,
  - The source of pow’r, the fount of love,
  - The rock of our salvation.

  - And ev’ry faithless murmur stills.
  - To him all praise and glory!

  - What his almighty pow’r hath made
  - His gracious mercy keepeth.
  - By morning glow or evening shade
  - His watchful eye ne’er sleepeth.
  - Within the kingdom of his might,
  - Lo! all is just and all is right.
  - To him all praise and glory!

  - The Lord is never far away,
  - But, thru all grief distressing,
  - An ever-present help and stay,
  - Our peace and joy and blessing.
  - As with a mother’s tender hand,
  - He leads his own, his chosen band.
  - To him all praise and glory!

  lines:
  - Thus, all my toilsome way along
  - I sing aloud thy praises,
  - That men may hear the grateful song
  - My voice unwearied raises.
  - Be joyful in the Lord, my heart!
  - Both soul and body bear your part.
  - To him all praise and glory!
