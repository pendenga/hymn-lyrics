  - Rejoice! Rejoice when Jesus reigns,
  - And Saints their songs employ,
  - While fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains

  - Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

  - No more will sin and sorrow grow,
  - Nor thorns infest the ground;
  - He’ll come and make the blessings flow
  - Far as the curse was found,
  - Far as the curse was found,
  - Far as, far as the curse was found.

  - Rejoice! Rejoice in the Most High,
  - While Israel spreads abroad
  - Like stars that glitter in the sky,
  - And ever worship God,
  - And ever worship God,
  - And ever, and ever worship God.
