- number: 1
  lines:
  - God moves in a mysterious way
  - His wonders to perform;
  - He plants his footsteps in the sea
  - And rides upon the storm.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Ye fearful Saints, fresh courage take;
  - The clouds ye so much dread
  - Are big with mercy and shall break
  - In blessings on your head.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - His purposes will ripen fast,
  - Unfolding ev’ry hour;
  - The bud may have a bitter taste,
  - But sweet will be the flower.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Blind unbelief is sure to err
  - And scan his works in vain;
  - God is his own interpreter,
  - And he will make it plain.
