verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - God of our fathers, known of old,
  - Lord of our far-flung battle line,
  - Beneath whose awful hand we hold
  - Dominion over palm and pine:
  - Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
  - Lest we forget, lest we forget.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The tumult and the shouting dies;
  - The captains and the kings depart.
  - Still stands thine ancient sacrifice,
  - An humble and a contrite heart.
  - Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
  - Lest we forget, lest we forget.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Far-called, our navies melt away;
  - On dune and headland sinks the fire.
  - Lo, all our pomp of yesterday
  - Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!
  - Judge of the nations, spare us yet,
  - Lest we forget, lest we forget.
