  - My country, ’tis of thee,

  - From ev’ry mountainside
  - Let freedom ring!

  - My native country, thee,
  - Land of the noble free,
  - Thy name I love;
  - I love thy rocks and rills,
  - Thy woods and templed hills.
  - My heart with rapture thrills
  - Like that above.

  lines:
  - Let music swell the breeze
  - And ring from all the trees
  - Sweet freedom’s song;
  - Let mortal tongues awake;
  - Let all that breathe partake;
  - Let rocks their silence break,
  - The sound prolong.

  lines:
  - Our fathers’ God, to thee,
  - Author of liberty,
  - To thee we sing;
  - Long may our land be bright
  - With freedom’s holy light.
  - Protect us by thy might,
  - Great God, our King!
