  - All glory, laud, and honor
  - To thee, Redeemer, King,

  - The company of angels
  - Are praising thee on high,
  - And mortal men and all things
  - Created make reply.

  - Before thee we present.

  - To thee, before thy passion,
  - They sang their hymns of praise;
  - To thee, now high exalted,
  - Our melody we raise.
  - Thou didst accept their praises;
  - Accept the love we bring,
  - Who in all good delightest,
  - Thou good and gracious King.
