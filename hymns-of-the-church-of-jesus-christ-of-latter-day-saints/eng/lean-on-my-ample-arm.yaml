  lines:
  - Lean on my ample arm,
  - O thou depressed!
  - And I will bid the storm
  - Cease in thy breast.
  - Whate’er thy lot may be
  - On life’s complaining sea,
  - If thou wilt come to me,
  - Thou shalt have rest.
  - If thou wilt come to me,
  - Thou shalt have rest.

  lines:
  - Lift up thy tearful eyes,
  - Sad heart, to me;
  - I am the sacrifice
  - Offered for thee.
  - In me thy pain shall cease,
  - In me is thy release,
  - In me thou shalt have peace
  - Eternally.
  - In me thou shalt have peace
  - Eternally.
