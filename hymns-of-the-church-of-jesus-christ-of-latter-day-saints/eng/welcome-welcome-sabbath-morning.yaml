  - Where they labor hard to teach us
  - By the Savior’s golden rule.

  - Hark! the Sabbath bells are ringing;
  - Hear the echoes all around.
  - List! the merry children singing!
  - What a pleasing, joyful sound!
  - Ev’ry tender note entreats us,
  - Bids us come, nor longer stay.
  - On our way the music greets us;
  - Hasten, hasten, come away.
  - Welcome, welcome, Sabbath morning;
  - Now we rest from ev’ry care.
  - Welcome, welcome is thy dawning,
  - Holy Sabbath, day of prayer.

  - Here we bow in meek devotion;
  - Here we sing God’s holy praise.
  - Here our hearts, with fond emotion,
  - Seek to learn his holy ways.
  - From the books of revelation
  - We are taught while yet in youth.
  - Words of heav’nly inspiration
  - Guide us in the path of truth.
  - Welcome, welcome, Sabbath morning;
  - Now we rest from ev’ry care.
  - Welcome, welcome is thy dawning,
  - Holy Sabbath, day of prayer.

  - Here we meet with friends and neighbors;
  - Parents too are in the throng.
  - We are earnest in our labors.
  - To God’s kingdom we belong.
  - Trials make our faith grow stronger;
  - Truth is nobler than a crown.
  - We will brave the tempest longer
  - Tho the world upon us frown.
  - Welcome, welcome, Sabbath morning;
  - Now we rest from ev’ry care.
  - Welcome, welcome is thy dawning,
  - Holy Sabbath, day of prayer.
