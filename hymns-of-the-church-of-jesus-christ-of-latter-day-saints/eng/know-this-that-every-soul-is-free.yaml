marking: Earnestly
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Know this, that ev’ry soul is free
  - To choose his life and what he’ll be;
  - For this eternal truth is giv’n:
  - That God will force no man to heav’n.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - He’ll call, persuade, direct aright,
  - And bless with wisdom, love, and light,
  - In nameless ways be good and kind,
  - But never force the human mind.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Freedom and reason make us men;
  - Take these away, what are we then?
  - Mere animals, and just as well
  - The beasts may think of heav’n or hell.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - May we no more our pow’rs abuse,
  - But ways of truth and goodness choose;
  - Our God is pleased when we improve
  - His grace and seek his perfect love.
