title: Does the Journey Seem Long
marking: Gently
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Does the journey seem long,
  - The path rugged and steep?
  - Are there briars and thorns on the way?
  - Do sharp stones cut your feet
  - As you struggle to rise
  - To the heights thru the heat of the day?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Is your heart faint and sad,
  - Your soul weary within,
  - As you toil ’neath your burden of care?
  - Does the load heavy seem
  - You are forced now to lift?
  - Is there no one your burden to share?
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Let your heart be not faint
  - Now the journey’s begun;
  - There is One who still beckons to you.
  - So look upward in joy
  - And take hold of his hand;
  - He will lead you to heights that are new—
- number: 4
  lines:
  - A land holy and pure,
  - Where all trouble doth end,
  - And your life shall be free from all sin,
  - Where no tears shall be shed,
  - For no sorrows remain.
  - Take his hand and with him enter in.
