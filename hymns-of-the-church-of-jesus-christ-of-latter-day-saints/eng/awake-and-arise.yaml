  - The heavens have opened their portals again.

  - Has burst like a dawn o’er the children of men!

  - The dream of the poet, the crown of the ages,
  - The time which the prophets of Israel foretold,
  - That glorious day only dreamed by the sages
  - Is yours, O ye slumbering nations; behold!

  - Let banners of peace in all lands be unfurled,
  - For truth, heaven-born, in its beauty and glory
  - Is marching triumphantly over the world.
