  - There is beauty all around
  - When there’s love at home;
  - There is joy in ev’ry sound
  - When there’s love at home.
  - Peace and plenty here abide,
  - Smiling sweet on ev’ry side.
  - Time doth softly, sweetly glide
  - When there’s love at home.

  - Time doth softly, sweetly glide
  - When there’s love at home.

  lines:
  - In the cottage there is joy
  - When there’s love at home;
  - Hate and envy ne’er annoy
  - When there’s love at home.
  - Roses bloom beneath our feet;
  - All the earth’s a garden sweet,
  - Making life a bliss complete
  - When there’s love at home.
  - Love at home, love at home;
  - Making life a bliss complete
  - When there’s love at home.

  lines:
  - Kindly heaven smiles above
  - When there’s love at home;
  - All the world is filled with love
  - When there’s love at home.
  - Sweeter sings the brooklet by;
  - Brighter beams the azure sky.
  - Oh, there’s One who smiles on high
  - When there’s love at home.
  - Love at home, love at home;
  - Oh, there’s One who smiles on high
  - When there’s love at home.
