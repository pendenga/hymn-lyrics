  - O thou Rock of our salvation,
  - Jesus, Savior of the world,
  - In our poor and lowly station

  - While we’re battling for the truth.

  - We a war ’gainst sin are waging;
  - We’re contending for the right.
  - Ev’ry day the battle’s raging;
  - Help us, Lord, to win the fight.

  - Gather round in strength of youth.
  - Ev’ry day the prospect’s fairer
  - While we’re battling for the truth.

  - Onward, onward, we’ll be singing
  - As we’re marching firm and true,
  - Each succeeding battle ringing,
  - Earnest of what we can do.

  - Gather round in strength of youth.
  - Ev’ry day the prospect’s fairer
  - While we’re battling for the truth.

  lines:
  - When for all that we’ve contended,
  - When the fight of faith we’ve won,
  - When the strife and battle’s ended,
  - And our labor here is done,
  - Then, O Rock of our salvation,
  - Jesus, Savior of the world,
  - Take us from our lowly station;
  - Let our flag with thee be furled.
