- number: 1
  lines:
  - For the strength of the hills we bless thee,
  - Our God, our fathers’ God;
  - Thou hast made thy children mighty
  - By the touch of the mountain sod.
  - Thou hast led thy chosen Israel
  - To freedom’s last abode;
  - For the strength of the hills we bless thee,
  - Our God, our fathers’ God.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - At the hands of foul oppressors
  - We’ve borne and suffered long;
  - Thou hast been our help in weakness,
  - And thy pow’r hath made us strong.
  - Amid ruthless foes outnumbered
  - In weariness we trod;
  - For the strength of the hills we bless thee,
  - Our God, our fathers’ God.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Thou hast led us here in safety
  - Where the mountain bulwark stands
  - As the guardian of the loved ones
  - Thou hast brought from many lands.
  - For the rock and for the river,
  - The valley’s fertile sod,
  - For the strength of the hills we bless thee,
  - Our God, our fathers’ God.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - We are watchers of a beacon
  - Whose light must never die;
  - We are guardians of an altar
  - ’Midst the silence of the sky.
  - Here the rocks yield founts of courage,
  - Struck forth as by thy rod;
  - For the strength of the hills we bless thee,
  - Our God, our fathers’ God.
