- number: 1
  lines:
  - O little town of Bethlehem,
  - How still we see thee lie.
  - Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
  - The silent stars go by;
  - Yet in thy dark streets shineth
  - The everlasting Light.
  - The hopes and fears of all the years
  - Are met in thee tonight.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - For Christ is born of Mary,
  - And, gathered all above
  - While mortals sleep, the angels keep
  - Their watch of wond’ring love.
  - O morning stars, together
  - Proclaim the holy birth,
  - And praises sing to God the King,
  - And peace to men on earth.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - How silently, how silently
  - The wondrous gift is giv’n!
  - So God imparts to human hearts
  - The blessings of his heav’n.
  - No ear may hear his coming;
  - But in this world of sin,
  - Where meek souls will receive him, still
  - The dear Christ enters in.
