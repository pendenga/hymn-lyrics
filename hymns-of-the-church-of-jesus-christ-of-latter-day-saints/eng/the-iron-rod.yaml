  - To Nephi, seer of olden time,
  - A vision came from God,
  - Wherein the holy word sublime
  - Was shown an iron rod.
  - Hold to the rod, the iron rod;
  - ’Tis strong, and bright, and true.
  - The iron rod is the word of God;
  - ’Twill safely guide us through.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - While on our journey here below,
  - Beneath temptation’s pow’r,
  - Through mists of darkness we must go,
  - In peril ev’ry hour.
  - Hold to the rod, the iron rod;
  - ’Tis strong, and bright, and true.
  - The iron rod is the word of God;
  - ’Twill safely guide us through.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - And when temptation’s pow’r is nigh,
  - Our pathway clouded o’er,
  - Upon the rod we can rely,
  - And heaven’s aid implore.
  - Hold to the rod, the iron rod;
  - ’Tis strong, and bright, and true.
  - The iron rod is the word of God;
  - ’Twill safely guide us through.

  lines:
  - And, hand o’er hand, the rod along,
  - Through each succeeding day,
  - With earnest prayer and hopeful song,
  - We’ll still pursue our way.
  - Hold to the rod, the iron rod;
  - ’Tis strong, and bright, and true.
  - The iron rod is the word of God;
  - ’Twill safely guide us through.

  lines:
  - Afar we see the golden rest
  - To which the rod will guide,
  - Where, with the angels bright and blest,
  - Forever we’ll abide.
  - Hold to the rod, the iron rod;
  - ’Tis strong, and bright, and true.
  - The iron rod is the word of God;
  - ’Twill safely guide us through.
