  - And worship Jesus face to face,
  - In Adam-ondi-Ahman.
- number: 2

  - We read that Enoch walked with God,
  - Above the pow’r of mammon,
  - While Zion spread herself abroad,
  - And Saints and angels sang aloud,
  - In Adam-ondi-Ahman.

  lines:
  - Her land was good and greatly blest,
  - Beyond all Israel’s Canaan;
  - Her fame was known from east to west,
  - Her peace was great, and pure the rest
  - Of Adam-ondi-Ahman.

  lines:
  - Hosanna to such days to come,
  - The Savior’s second coming,
  - When all the earth in glorious bloom
  - Affords the Saints a holy home,
  - Like Adam-ondi-Ahman.
