  - When the days are gloomy,
  - Sing some happy song;
  - Meet the world’s repining
  - With a courage strong.
  - Go with faith undaunted
  - Thru the ills of life;
  - Scatter smiles and sunshine
  - O’er its toil and strife.
  - Scatter sunshine all along your way.
  - Cheer and bless and brighten
  - Ev’ry passing day.
  - Scatter sunshine all along your way.
  - Cheer and bless and brighten
  - Ev’ry passing day.
