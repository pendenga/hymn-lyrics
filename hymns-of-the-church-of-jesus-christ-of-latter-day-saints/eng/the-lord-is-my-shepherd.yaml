  - The Lord is my Shepherd; no want shall I know.
  - I feed in green pastures; safe-folded I rest.
  - He leadeth my soul where the still waters flow,
  - Restores me when wand’ring, redeems when oppressed,
  - Restores me when wand’ring, redeems when oppressed.

  - Thru the valley and shadow of death though I stray,
  - Since thou art my Guardian, no evil I fear.
  - Thy rod shall defend me, thy staff be my stay.
  - No harm can befall with my Comforter near.
  - No harm can befall with my Comforter near.

  - In the midst of affliction my table is spread.
  - With blessings unmeasured my cup runneth o’er.
  - With perfume and oil thou anointest my head.
  - Oh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?
  - Oh, what shall I ask of thy providence more?
