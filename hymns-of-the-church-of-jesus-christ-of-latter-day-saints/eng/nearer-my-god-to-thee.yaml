  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer to thee!
  - E’en though it be a cross
  - That raiseth me.
  - Still all my song shall be
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer to thee!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Though like the wanderer,
  - The sun gone down,
  - Darkness be over me,
  - My rest a stone,
  - Yet in my dreams I’d be
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer to thee!
- number: 3
  lines:
  - There let the way appear,
  - Steps unto heav’n;
  - All that thou sendest me,
  - In mercy giv’n;
  - Angels to beckon me
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer to thee!
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Then with my waking thoughts
  - Bright with thy praise,
  - Out of my stony griefs
  - Bethel I’ll raise;
  - So by my woes to be
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer to thee!
- number: 5
  lines:
  - Or if, on joyful wing
  - Cleaving the sky,
  - Sun, moon, and stars forgot,
  - Upward I fly,
  - Still all my song shall be
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer, my God, to thee,
  - Nearer to thee!
