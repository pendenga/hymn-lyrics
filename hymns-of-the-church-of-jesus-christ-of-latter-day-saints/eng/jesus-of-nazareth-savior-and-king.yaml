- number: 1
  lines:
  - Jesus of Nazareth,
  - Savior and King!
  - Triumphant over death,
  - Life thou didst bring,
  - Leaving thy Father’s throne,
  - On earth to live,
  - Thy work to do alone,
  - Thy life to give.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - While of this broken bread
  - Humbly we eat,
  - Our thoughts to thee are led
  - In rev’rence sweet.
  - Bruised, broken, torn for us
  - On Calvary’s hill—
  - Thy suff’ring borne for us
  - Lives with us still.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - As to our lips the cup
  - Gently we press,
  - Our hearts are lifted up;
  - Thy name we bless!
  - Guide us where’er we go,
  - Till in the end
  - Life evermore we’ll know
  - Through thee, our Friend.
