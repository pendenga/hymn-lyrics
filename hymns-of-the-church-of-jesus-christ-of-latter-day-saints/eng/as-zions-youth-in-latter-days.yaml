- number: 1
  lines:
  - As Zion’s youth in latter days,
  - We stand with valiant heart,
  - With promise shining in our eyes,
  - Resolved to do our part.
  - Upon a noble past we build;
  - The future fills our view.
  - We face the challenge of our day
  - And pledge we will be true.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The truths and values we embrace
  - Are mocked on ev’ry hand.
  - Yet as we listen and obey
  - We know we can withstand
  - The evils that would weaken us,
  - The sin that would destroy.
  - With faith, we hold the iron rod
  - And find in this our joy.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Thru test and trial we’ll have our fears,
  - But we will not despair.
  - We’re here to serve a righteous cause;
  - Truth gives us strength to dare.
  - We’ll love, and learn, and overcome;
  - We’ll sing a joyful song,
  - As Zion’s youth in latter days,
  - Triumphant, pure, and strong.
