verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Our mountain home so dear,
  - Where crystal waters clear
  - Flow ever free,
  - Flow ever free,
  - While thru the valleys wide
  - The flow’rs on ev’ry side,
  - Blooming in stately pride,
  - Are fair to see.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - We’ll roam the verdant hills
  - And by the sparkling rills
  - Pluck the wildflow’rs,
  - Pluck the wildflow’rs;
  - The fragrance on the air,
  - The landscape bright and fair,
  - And sunshine ev’rywhere
  - Make pleasant hours.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - In sylvan depth and shade,
  - In forest and in glade,
  - Where-e’er we pass,
  - Where-e’er we pass,
  - The hand of God we see
  - In leaf and bud and tree,
  - Or bird or humming bee,
  - Or blade of grass.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - The streamlet, flow’r, and sod
  - Bespeak the works of God;
  - And all combine,
  - And all combine,
  - With most transporting grace,
  - His handiwork to trace,
  - Thru nature’s smiling face,
  - In art divine.
