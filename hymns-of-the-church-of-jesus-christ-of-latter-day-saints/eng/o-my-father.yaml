marking: Fervently
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - O my Father, thou that dwellest
  - In the high and glorious place,
  - When shall I regain thy presence
  - And again behold thy face?
  - In thy holy habitation,
  - Did my spirit once reside?
  - In my first primeval childhood
  - Was I nurtured near thy side?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - For a wise and glorious purpose
  - Thou hast placed me here on earth
  - And withheld the recollection
  - Of my former friends and birth;
  - Yet ofttimes a secret something
  - Whispered, “You’re a stranger here,”
  - And I felt that I had wandered
  - From a more exalted sphere.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - I had learned to call thee Father,
  - Thru thy Spirit from on high,
  - But, until the key of knowledge
  - Was restored, I knew not why.
  - In the heav’ns are parents single?
  - No, the thought makes reason stare!
  - Truth is reason; truth eternal
  - Tells me I’ve a mother there.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - When I leave this frail existence,
  - When I lay this mortal by,
  - Father, Mother, may I meet you
  - In your royal courts on high?
  - Then, at length, when I’ve completed
  - All you sent me forth to do,
  - With your mutual approbation
  - Let me come and dwell with you.
