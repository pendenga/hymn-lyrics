  lines:
  - God is in his holy temple.
  - Earthly thoughts, be silent now,
  - While with rev’rence we assemble
  - And before his presence bow.
  - He is with us, now and ever,
  - When we call upon his name,
  - Aiding ev’ry good endeavor,
  - Guiding ev’ry upward aim.

  lines:
  - God is in his holy temple,
  - In the pure and holy mind,
  - In the rev’rent heart and simple,
  - In the soul from sin refined.
  - Banish then each base emotion.
  - Lift us up, O Lord, to thee;
  - Let our souls, in pure devotion,
  - Temples for thy worship be.
