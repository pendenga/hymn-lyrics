- number: 1
  lines:
  - How could the Father tell the world of love and tenderness?
  - He sent his Son, a newborn babe, with peace and holiness.
  - How could the Father show the world the pathway we should go?
  - He sent his Son to walk with men on earth, that we may know.
  - How could the Father tell the world of sacrifice, of death?
  - He sent his Son to die for us and rise with living breath.
  - What does the Father ask of us? What do the scriptures say?
  - Have faith, have hope, live like his Son, help others on their way.
  - What does he ask? Live like his Son.
