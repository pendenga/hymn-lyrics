  - Come, ye children of the Lord,
  - Let us sing with one accord.
  - Let us raise a joyful strain

  - When our Savior we shall see!
  - When in splendor he’ll descend,

  - When our fears shall flee away!

  - All arrayed in spotless white,
  - We will dwell ’mid truth and light.
  - We will sing the songs of praise;
  - We will shout in joyous lays.
  - Earth shall then be cleansed from sin.
  - Ev’ry living thing therein
  - Shall in love and beauty dwell;
  - Then with joy each heart will swell.
