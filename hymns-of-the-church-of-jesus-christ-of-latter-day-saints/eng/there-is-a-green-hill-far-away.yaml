  - There is a green hill far away,
  - Without a city wall,
  - Where the dear Lord was crucified,
  - Who died to save us all.

  - We may not know, we cannot tell,
  - What pains he had to bear,
  - But we believe it was for us
  - He hung and suffered there.

  - There was no other good enough
  - To pay the price of sin.

  - Of heav’n and let us in.

  - And we must love him too,
  - And trust in his redeeming blood,
  - And try his works to do.
