marking: Joyfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Come, listen to a prophet’s voice,
  - And hear the word of God,
  - And in the way of truth rejoice,
  - And sing for joy aloud.
  - We’ve found the way the prophets went
  - Who lived in days of yore.
  - Another prophet now is sent
  - This knowledge to restore.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The gloom of sullen darkness spread
  - Thru earth’s extended space
  - Is banished by our living Head,
  - And God has shown his face.
  - Thru erring schemes in days now past
  - The world has gone astray;
  - Yet Saints of God have found at last
  - The straight and narrow way.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - ’Tis not in man they put their trust
  - Nor on his arm rely.
  - Full well assured, all are accursed
  - Who Jesus Christ deny.
  - The Savior to his people saith,
  - “Let all my words obey,
  - And signs shall follow living faith,
  - Down to the latest day.”
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Then heed the words of truth and light
  - That flow from fountains pure.
  - Yea, keep His law with all thy might
  - Till thine election’s sure,
  - Till thou shalt hear the holy voice
  - Assure eternal reign,
  - While joy and cheer attend thy choice,
  - As one who shall obtain.
