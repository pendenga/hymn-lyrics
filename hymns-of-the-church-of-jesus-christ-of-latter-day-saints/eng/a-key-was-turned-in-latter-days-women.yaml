- number: 1
  lines:
  - A key was turned in latter days,
  - A blessing to restore—
  - A gift of charity and peace—
  - To earth forevermore.
  - Our Father, we would turn our hearts
  - To those who seek thy face,
  - Give hope and comfort to the poor
  - In mem’ry of thy grace.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - A hand of mercy we’ll extend;
  - Thy Son has shown the way.
  - And light and knowledge will attend
  - Our service in his name.
  - O sisters, let us join our hands;
  - We’ll humbly seek his face,
  - Assure our hearts before our Lord
  - By deeds of love and praise.
