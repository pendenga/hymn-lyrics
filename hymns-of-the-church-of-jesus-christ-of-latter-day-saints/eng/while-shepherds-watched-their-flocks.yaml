- number: 1
  lines:
  - While shepherds watch’d their flocks by night,
  - All seated on the ground,
  - The angel of the Lord came down,
  - And glory shone around.
  - “Fear not,” said he, for mighty dread
  - Had seized their troubled mind;
  - “Glad tidings of great joy I bring
  - To you and all mankind.”
- number: 2
  lines:
  - “To you, in David’s town this day,
  - Is born of David’s line
  - The Savior who is Christ the Lord,
  - And this shall be the sign:
  - The heav’nly Babe you there shall find
  - To human view displayed,
  - All meanly wrapped in swathing bands,
  - And in a manger laid.”
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Thus spake the seraph, and forthwith
  - Appeared a shining throng
  - Of angels praising God, who thus
  - Addressed their joyful song:
  - “All glory be to God on high
  - And on the earth be peace.
  - Goodwill henceforth from heav’n to men
  - Begin and never cease.”
