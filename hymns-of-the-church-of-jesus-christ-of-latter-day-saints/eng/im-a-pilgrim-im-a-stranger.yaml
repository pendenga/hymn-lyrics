title: Im a Pilgrim Im a Stranger
marking: Thoughtfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - I’m a pilgrim, I’m a stranger
  - Cast upon the rocky shore
  - Of a land where deathly danger
  - Surges with a sullen roar,
  - Oft despairing, oft despairing,
  - Lest I reach my home no more.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Misty vapors rise before me.
  - Scarcely can I see the way.
  - Clouds of darkest hue hang o’er me,
  - And I’m apt to go astray
  - With the many, with the many
  - That are now the vulture’s prey.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - O my Father, I entreat thee,
  - Let me see thy beck’ning hand;
  - And when straying, may I meet thee
  - Ere I join the silent band.
  - Guide me, Father, guide me, Father,
  - Safely to the promised land.
