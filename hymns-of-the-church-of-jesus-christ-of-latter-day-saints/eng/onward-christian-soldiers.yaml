  - At the sign of triumph
  - Satan’s host doth flee;
  - On, then, Christian soldiers,
  - On to victory.
  - Hell’s foundations quiver
  - At the shout of praise;
  - Brothers, lift your voices,
  - Loud your anthems raise.
  - Onward, Christian soldiers!
  - Marching as to war,
  - With the cross of Jesus
  - Going on before.

  - Like a mighty army
  - Moves the Church of God;
  - Brothers, we are treading
  - Where the Saints have trod.
  - We are not divided;
  - All one body we:
  - One in hope and doctrine,
  - One in charity.
  - Onward, Christian soldiers!
  - Marching as to war,
  - With the cross of Jesus
  - Going on before.

  - Onward, then, ye people;
  - Join our happy throng.
  - Blend with ours your voices
  - In the triumph song:
  - Glory, laud, and honor
  - Unto Christ, the King.
  - This through countless ages
  - Men and angels sing.
  - Onward, Christian soldiers!
  - Marching as to war,
  - With the cross of Jesus
  - Going on before.
