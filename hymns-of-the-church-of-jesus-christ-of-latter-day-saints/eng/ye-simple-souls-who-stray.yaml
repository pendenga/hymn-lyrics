verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Ye simple souls who stray
  - Far from the path of peace,
  - That lonely, unfrequented way
  - To life and happiness,
  - Why will ye folly love,
  - And throng the downward road,
  - And hate the wisdom from above,
  - And mock the sons of God?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Madness and misery
  - Ye count our life beneath,
  - And nothing great or good can see
  - Or glorious in our death.
  - But thru the Holy Ghost
  - We witness better things,
  - For he whose blood is all our boast
  - Has made us priests and kings.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Riches unsearchable
  - In Jesus’ love we know,
  - And pleasures springing from the well
  - Of life our souls o’erflow.
  - As we seek heav’nly bliss,
  - Angels our steps attend,
  - And God himself our Father is,
  - And Jesus is our Friend.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - With him we walk in white;
  - We in his image shine;
  - Our robes are robes of glorious light,
  - Our righteousness divine.
  - On all the kings of earth
  - With pity we look down
  - And claim, in virtue of our birth,
  - A never-fading crown.
