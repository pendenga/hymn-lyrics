title: Where Can I Turn for Peace
marking: Thoughtfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Where can I turn for peace?
  - Where is my solace
  - When other sources cease to make me whole?
  - When with a wounded heart, anger, or malice,
  - I draw myself apart,
  - Searching my soul?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Where, when my aching grows,
  - Where, when I languish,
  - Where, in my need to know, where can I run?
  - Where is the quiet hand to calm my anguish?
  - Who, who can understand?
  - He, only One.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - He answers privately,
  - Reaches my reaching
  - In my Gethsemane, Savior and Friend.
  - Gentle the peace he finds for my beseeching.
  - Constant he is and kind,
  - Love without end.
