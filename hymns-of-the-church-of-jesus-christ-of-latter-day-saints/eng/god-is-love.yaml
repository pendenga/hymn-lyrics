- number: 1
  lines:
  - Earth, with her ten thousand flow’rs,
  - Air, with all its beams and show’rs,
  - Heaven’s infinite expanse,
  - Sea’s resplendent countenance—
  - All around and all above
  - Bear this record: God is love.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Sounds among the vales and hills,
  - In the woods and by the rills,
  - Of the breeze and of the bird,
  - By the gentle murmur stirred—
  - Sacred songs, beneath, above,
  - Have one chorus: God is love.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - All the hopes that sweetly start
  - From the fountain of the heart,
  - All the bliss that ever comes
  - To our earthly human homes,
  - All the voices from above
  - Sweetly whisper: God is love.
