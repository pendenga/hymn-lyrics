  - Abide with me! fast falls the eventide;
  - The darkness deepens. Lord, with me abide!
  - When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
  - Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me!

  lines:
  - Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day.
  - Earth’s joys grow dim; its glories pass away.
  - Change and decay in all around I see;
  - O thou who changest not, abide with me!

  - I need thy presence ev’ry passing hour.
  - What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s pow’r?
  - Who, like thyself, my guide and stay can be?
  - Thru cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me!
