- number: 1
  lines:
  - Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!
  - That calls me from a world of care
  - And bids me at my Father’s throne
  - Make all my wants and wishes known.
  - In seasons of distress and grief,
  - My soul has often found relief
  - And oft escaped the tempter’s snare
  - By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!
  - And oft escaped the tempter’s snare
  - By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

  lines:
  - Sweet hour of prayer! Sweet hour of prayer!
  - Thy wings shall my petition bear
  - To him whose truth and faithfulness
  - Engage the waiting soul to bless.
  - And since he bids me seek his face,
  - Believe his word, and trust his grace,
  - I’ll cast on him my ev’ry care
  - And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!
  - I’ll cast on him my ev’ry care
  - And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!
