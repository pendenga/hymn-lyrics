- number: 1
  lines:
  - Oh, how lovely was the morning!
  - Radiant beamed the sun above.
  - Bees were humming, sweet birds singing,
  - Music ringing thru the grove,
  - When within the shady woodland
  - Joseph sought the God of love,
  - When within the shady woodland
  - Joseph sought the God of love.

  lines:
  - Humbly kneeling, sweet appealing—
  - ’Twas the boy’s first uttered prayer—
  - When the pow’rs of sin assailing
  - Filled his soul with deep despair;
  - But undaunted, still he trusted
  - In his Heav’nly Father’s care,
  - But undaunted, still he trusted
  - In his Heav’nly Father’s care.

  lines:
  - Suddenly a light descended,
  - Brighter far than noonday sun,
  - And a shining, glorious pillar
  - O’er him fell, around him shone,
  - While appeared two heav’nly beings,
  - God the Father and the Son,
  - While appeared two heav’nly beings,
  - God the Father and the Son.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - “Joseph, this is my Beloved;
  - Hear him!” Oh, how sweet the word!
  - Joseph’s humble prayer was answered,
  - And he listened to the Lord.
  - Oh, what rapture filled his bosom,
  - For he saw the living God,
  - Oh, what rapture filled his bosom,
  - For he saw the living God.
