  - Oh, beautiful for spacious skies,
  - For amber waves of grain,
  - For purple mountain majesties
  - Above the fruited plain!
  - America! America!
  - God shed his grace on thee,
  - And crown thy good with brotherhood
  - From sea to shining sea.

  lines:
  - Oh, beautiful for pilgrim feet,
  - Whose stern, impassioned stress
  - A thoroughfare of freedom beat
  - Across the wilderness!
  - America! America!
  - God mend thine ev’ry flaw,
  - Confirm thy soul in self-control,
  - Thy liberty in law.

  lines:
  - Oh, beautiful for heroes proved
  - In liberating strife,
  - Who more than self their country loved,
  - And mercy more than life!
  - America! America!
  - May God thy gold refine,
  - Till all success be nobleness,
  - And ev’ry gain divine.

  lines:
  - Oh, beautiful for patriot dream
  - That sees beyond the years
  - Thine alabaster cities gleam,
  - Undimmed by human tears!
  - America! America!
  - God shed his grace on thee,
  - And crown thy good with brotherhood
  - From sea to shining sea.
