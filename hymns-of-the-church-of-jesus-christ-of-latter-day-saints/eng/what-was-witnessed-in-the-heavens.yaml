- number: 1
  lines:
  - What was witnessed in the heavens?
  - Why, an angel earthward bound.
  - Had he something with him bringing?
  - Yes, the gospel, joyful sound!
  - It was to be preached in power
  - On the earth, the angel said,
  - To all men, all tongues and nations
  - That upon its face are spread.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Had we not before the gospel?
  - Yes, it came of old to men.
  - Then what is this latter gospel?
  - ’Tis the first one come again.
  - This was preached by Paul and Peter
  - And by Jesus Christ, the Head.
  - This we latter Saints are preaching;
  - We their footsteps wish to tread.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Where so long has been the gospel?
  - Did it pass from earth away?
  - Yes, ’twas taken back to heaven
  - Till should dawn a brighter day.
  - What became of those departed,
  - Knowing not the gospel plan?
  - In the spirit world they’ll hear it;
  - God is just to ev’ry man.
