  - And gladly hail the glorious hour;

  - And all may feel the gospel’s pow’r.

  - The day by holy men foretold,
  - When man no more with man will strive,
  - And all in each a friend behold.

  - Nor tyrant hold relentless sway,
  - But love to God and man abound
  - Thruout the long millennial day.
