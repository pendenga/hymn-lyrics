- number: 1
  lines:
  - I’m trying to be like Jesus;
  - I’m following in his ways.
  - I’m trying to love as he did, in all that I do and say.
  - At times I am tempted to make a wrong choice,
  - But I try to listen as the still small voice whispers:
  - Love one another as Jesus loves you.
  - Try to show kindness in all that you do.
  - Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought,
  - For these are the things Jesus taught.

  lines:
  - I’m trying to love my neighbor;
  - I’m learning to serve my friends.
  - I watch for the day of gladness when Jesus will come again.
  - I try to remember the lessons he taught.
  - Then the Holy Spirit enters into my thoughts, saying:
  - Love one another as Jesus loves you.
  - Try to show kindness in all that you do.
  - Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought,
  - For these are the things Jesus taught.
