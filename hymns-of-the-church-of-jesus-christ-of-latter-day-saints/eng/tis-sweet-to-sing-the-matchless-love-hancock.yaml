  - ’Tis sweet to sing the matchless love
  - Of Him who left his home above
  - And came to earth—oh, wondrous plan—
  - To suffer, bleed, and die for man!
  - For Jesus died on Calvary,
  - That all thru him might ransomed be.
  - Then sing hosannas to his name;
  - Let heav’n and earth his love proclaim.

  lines:
  - ’Tis good to meet each Sabbath day
  - And, in his own appointed way,
  - Partake the emblems of his death,
  - And thus renew our love and faith.
  - For Jesus died on Calvary,
  - That all thru him might ransomed be.
  - Then sing hosannas to his name;
  - Let heav’n and earth his love proclaim.

  lines:
  - Oh, blessed hour! communion sweet!
  - When children, friends, and teachers meet
  - And, in remembrance of his grace,
  - Unite in sweetest songs of praise.
  - For Jesus died on Calvary,
  - That all thru him might ransomed be.
  - Then sing hosannas to his name;
  - Let heav’n and earth his love proclaim.
