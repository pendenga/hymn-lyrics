verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - School thy feelings, O my brother;
  - Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
  - Do not its emotions smother,
  - But let wisdom’s voice control.
  - School thy feelings; there is power
  - In the cool, collected mind.
  - Passion shatters reason’s tower,
  - Makes the clearest vision blind.
  - School thy feelings, O my brother;
  - Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
  - Do not its emotions smother,
  - But let wisdom’s voice control.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - School thy feelings; condemnation
  - Never pass on friend or foe,
  - Though the tide of accusation
  - Like a flood of truth may flow.
  - Hear defense before deciding,
  - And a ray of light may gleam,
  - Showing thee what filth is hiding
  - Underneath the shallow stream.
  - School thy feelings, O my brother;
  - Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
  - Do not its emotions smother,
  - But let wisdom’s voice control.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Should affliction’s acrid vial
  - Burst o’er thy unsheltered head,
  - School thy feelings to the trial;
  - Half its bitterness hath fled.
  - Art thou falsely, basely, slandered?
  - Does the world begin to frown?
  - Gauge thy wrath by wisdom’s standard;
  - Keep thy rising anger down.
  - School thy feelings, O my brother;
  - Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
  - Do not its emotions smother,
  - But let wisdom’s voice control.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Rest thyself on this assurance:
  - Time’s a friend to innocence,
  - And the patient, calm endurance
  - Wins respect and aids defense.
  - Noblest minds have finest feelings;
  - Quiv’ring strings a breath can move;
  - And the gospel’s sweet revealings
  - Tune them with the key of love.
  - School thy feelings, O my brother;
  - Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
  - Do not its emotions smother,
  - But let wisdom’s voice control.
- number: 5
  lines:
  - Hearts so sensitively molded
  - Strongly fortified should be,
  - Trained to firmness and enfolded
  - In a calm tranquility.
  - Wound not willfully another;
  - Conquer haste with reason’s might;
  - School thy feelings, sister, brother;
  - Train them in the path of right.
  - School thy feelings, O my brother;
  - Train thy warm, impulsive soul.
  - Do not its emotions smother,
  - But let wisdom’s voice control.
