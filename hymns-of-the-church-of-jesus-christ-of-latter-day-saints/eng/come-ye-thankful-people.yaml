  lines:
  - Come, ye thankful people, come;
  - Raise the song of harvest home.
  - All is safely gathered in
  - Ere the winter storms begin.
  - God, our Maker, doth provide
  - For our wants to be supplied.
  - Come to God’s own temple, come;
  - Raise the song of harvest home.

  lines:
  - All the world is God’s own field,
  - Fruit unto his praise to yield,
  - Wheat and tares together sown,
  - Unto joy or sorrow grown.
  - First the blade, and then the ear,
  - Then the full corn shall appear.
  - Lord of harvest, grant that we
  - Wholesome grain and pure may be.
