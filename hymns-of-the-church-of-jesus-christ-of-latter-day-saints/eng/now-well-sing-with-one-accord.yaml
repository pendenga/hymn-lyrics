verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Now we’ll sing with one accord,
  - For a prophet of the Lord,
  - Bringing forth his precious word,
  - Cheers the Saints as anciently.
  - When the world in darkness lay,
  - Lo! he sought the better way,
  - And he heard the Savior say,
  - “Go and prune my vineyard, son!”
- number: 2
  lines:
  - And an angel surely then,
  - For a blessing unto men,
  - Brought the priesthood back again
  - In its ancient purity.
  - Even Joseph he inspired;
  - Yea, his heart he truly fired
  - With the light that he desired
  - For the work of righteousness.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - And the Book of Mormon true,
  - With its cov’nant ever new,
  - For the Gentile and the Jew,
  - He translated sacredly.
  - God’s commandments to mankind,
  - For believing Saints designed,
  - And to bless the seeking mind,
  - Came to him from Jesus Christ.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Precious are the years to come,
  - While the righteous gather home
  - For the great millennium,
  - When they’ll rest in blessedness.
  - Prudent in this world of woes,
  - They will triumph o’er their foes,
  - While the realm of Zion grows
  - Purer for eternity.
