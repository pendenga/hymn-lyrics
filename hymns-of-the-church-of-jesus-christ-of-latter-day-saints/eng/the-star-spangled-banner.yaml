verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Oh say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
  - What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,
  - Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight,
  - O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
  - And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
  - Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there.
  - Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
  - O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - On the shore, dimly seen thru the mists of the deep,
  - Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
  - What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
  - As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
  - Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
  - In full glory reflected now shines on the stream;
  - ’Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh, long may it wave
  - O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Oh, thus be it ever, when free men shall stand
  - Between their loved homes and the war’s desolation!
  - Blest with vict’ry and peace, may the heav’n-rescued land
  - Praise the Pow’r that hath made and preserved us a nation!
  - Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just,
  - And this be our motto: “In God is our trust!”
  - And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
  - O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!
