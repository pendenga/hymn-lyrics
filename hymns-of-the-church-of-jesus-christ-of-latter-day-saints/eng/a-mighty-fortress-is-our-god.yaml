  lines:
  - A mighty fortress is our God,
  - A tower of strength ne’er failing.
  - A helper mighty is our God,
  - O’er ills of life prevailing.
  - He overcometh all.
  - He saveth from the Fall.
  - His might and pow’r are great.
  - He all things did create.
  - And he shall reign for evermore.
