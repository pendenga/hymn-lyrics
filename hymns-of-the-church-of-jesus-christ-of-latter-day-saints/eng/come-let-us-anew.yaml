marking: Resolutely
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Come, let us anew our journey pursue,
  - Roll round with the year,
  - And never stand still till the Master appear.
  - His adorable will let us gladly fulfill,
  - And our talents improve
  - By the patience of hope and the labor of love,
  - By the patience of hope and the labor of love.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Our life as a dream, our time as a stream
  - Glide swiftly away,
  - And the fugitive moment refuses to stay;
  - For the arrow is flown and the moments are gone.
  - The millennial year
  - Presses on to our view, and eternity’s here,
  - Presses on to our view, and eternity’s here.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Oh, that each in the day of His coming may say,
  - “I have fought my way thru;
  - I have finished the work thou didst give me to do.”
  - Oh, that each from his Lord may receive the glad word:
  - “Well and faithfully done;
  - Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne;
  - Enter into my joy and sit down on my throne.”
