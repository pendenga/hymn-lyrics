- number: 1
  lines:
  - Brightly beams our Father’s mercy
  - From his lighthouse evermore,
  - But to us he gives the keeping
  - Of the lights along the shore.
  - Let the lower lights be burning;
  - Send a gleam across the wave.
  - Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
  - You may rescue, you may save.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Dark the night of sin has settled;
  - Loud the angry billows roar.
  - Eager eyes are watching, longing,
  - For the lights along the shore.
  - Let the lower lights be burning;
  - Send a gleam across the wave.
  - Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
  - You may rescue, you may save.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Trim your feeble lamp, my brother;
  - Some poor sailor, tempest-tossed,
  - Trying now to make the harbor,
  - In the darkness may be lost.
  - Let the lower lights be burning;
  - Send a gleam across the wave.
  - Some poor fainting, struggling seaman
  - You may rescue, you may save.
