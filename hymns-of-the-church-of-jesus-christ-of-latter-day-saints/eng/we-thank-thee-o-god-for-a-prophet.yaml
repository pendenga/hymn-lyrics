  lines:
  - We thank thee, O God, for a prophet
  - To guide us in these latter days.
  - We thank thee for sending the gospel
  - To lighten our minds with its rays.
  - We thank thee for every blessing
  - Bestowed by thy bounteous hand.
  - We feel it a pleasure to serve thee
  - And love to obey thy command.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - When dark clouds of trouble hang o’er us
  - And threaten our peace to destroy,
  - There is hope smiling brightly before us,
  - And we know that deliv’rance is nigh.
  - We doubt not the Lord nor his goodness.
  - We’ve proved him in days that are past.
  - The wicked who fight against Zion
  - Will surely be smitten at last.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - We’ll sing of his goodness and mercy.
  - We’ll praise him by day and by night,
  - Rejoice in his glorious gospel,
  - And bask in its life-giving light.
  - Thus on to eternal perfection
  - The honest and faithful will go,
  - While they who reject this glad message
  - Shall never such happiness know.
