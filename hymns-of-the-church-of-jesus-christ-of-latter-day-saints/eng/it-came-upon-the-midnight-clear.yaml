title: It Came upon the Midnight Clear
marking: Brightly
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - It came upon the midnight clear,
  - That glorious song of old,
  - From angels bending near the earth
  - To touch their harps of gold:
  - “Peace on the earth, good will to men
  - From heav’n’s all-gracious King.”
  - The world in solemn stillness lay
  - To hear the angels sing.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Still thru the cloven skies they come
  - With peaceful wings unfurled,
  - And still their heav’nly music floats
  - O’er all the weary world.
  - Above its sad and lowly plains
  - They bend on hov’ring wing,
  - And ever o’er its babel sounds
  - The blessed angels sing.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - For lo! the days are hast’ning on,
  - By prophets seen of old,
  - When with the ever-circling years
  - Shall come the time foretold,
  - When the new heav’n and earth shall own
  - The Prince of Peace their King,
  - And the whole world send back the song
  - Which now the angels sing.
