marking: Resolutely
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Come, come, ye Saints, no toil nor labor fear;
  - But with joy wend your way.
  - Though hard to you this journey may appear,
  - Grace shall be as your day.
  - ’Tis better far for us to strive
  - Our useless cares from us to drive;
  - Do this, and joy your hearts will swell—
  - All is well! All is well!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Why should we mourn or think our lot is hard?
  - ’Tis not so; all is right.
  - Why should we think to earn a great reward
  - If we now shun the fight?
  - Gird up your loins; fresh courage take.
  - Our God will never us forsake;
  - And soon we’ll have this tale to tell—
  - All is well! All is well!
- number: 3
  lines:
  - We’ll find the place which God for us prepared,
  - Far away in the West,
  - Where none shall come to hurt or make afraid;
  - There the Saints will be blessed.
  - We’ll make the air with music ring,
  - Shout praises to our God and King;
  - Above the rest these words we’ll tell—
  - All is well! All is well!
- number: 4
  lines:
  - And should we die before our journey’s through,
  - Happy day! All is well!
  - We then are free from toil and sorrow, too;
  - With the just we shall dwell!
  - But if our lives are spared again
  - To see the Saints their rest obtain,
  - Oh, how we’ll make this chorus swell—
  - All is well! All is well!
