- number: 1
  lines:
  - Thy Spirit, Lord, has stirred our souls,
  - And by its inward shining glow
  - We see anew our sacred goals
  - And feel thy nearness here below.
  - No burning bush near Sinai
  - Could show thy presence, Lord, more nigh.

  - “Did not our hearts within us burn?”
  - We know the Spirit’s fire is here.
  - It makes our souls for service yearn;
  - It makes the path of duty clear.
  - Lord, may it prompt us, day by day,
  - In all we do, in all we say.
