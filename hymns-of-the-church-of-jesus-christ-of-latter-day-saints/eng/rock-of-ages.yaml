verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
  - Let me hide myself in thee;
  - Let the water and the blood,
  - From thy wounded side which flowed,
  - Be of sin the double cure,
  - Save from wrath and make me pure.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Not the labors of my hands
  - Can fill all thy law’s demands;
  - Could my zeal no respite know,
  - Could my tears forever flow,
  - All for sin could not atone;
  - Thou must save, and thou alone.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - While I draw this fleeting breath,
  - When mine eyes shall close in death,
  - When I rise to worlds unknown
  - And behold thee on thy throne,
  - Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
  - Let me hide myself in thee.
