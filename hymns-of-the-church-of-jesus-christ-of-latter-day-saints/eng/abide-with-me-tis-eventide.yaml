- number: 1
  lines:
  - Abide with me; ’tis eventide.
  - The day is past and gone;
  - The shadows of the evening fall;
  - The night is coming on.
  - Within my heart a welcome guest,
  - Within my home abide.
  - O Savior, stay this night with me;
  - Behold, ’tis eventide.
  - O Savior, stay this night with me;
  - Behold, ’tis eventide.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Abide with me; ’tis eventide.
  - Thy walk today with me
  - Has made my heart within me burn,
  - As I communed with thee.
  - Thy earnest words have filled my soul
  - And kept me near thy side.
  - O Savior, stay this night with me;
  - Behold, ’tis eventide.
  - O Savior, stay this night with me;
  - Behold, ’tis eventide.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Abide with me; ’tis eventide,
  - And lone will be the night
  - If I cannot commune with thee
  - Nor find in thee my light.
  - The darkness of the world, I fear,
  - Would in my home abide.
  - O Savior, stay this night with me;
  - Behold, ’tis eventide.
  - O Savior, stay this night with me;
  - Behold, ’tis eventide.
