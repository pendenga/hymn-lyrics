- number: 1
  lines:
  - Rev’rently and meekly now,
  - Let thy head most humbly bow.
  - Think of me, thou ransomed one;
  - Think what I for thee have done.
  - With my blood that dripped like rain,
  - Sweat in agony of pain,
  - With my body on the tree
  - I have ransomed even thee.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - In this bread now blest for thee,
  - Emblem of my body see;
  - In this water or this wine,
  - Emblem of my blood divine.
  - Oh, remember what was done
  - That the sinner might be won.
  - On the cross of Calvary
  - I have suffered death for thee.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Bid thine heart all strife to cease;
  - With thy brethren be at peace.
  - Oh, forgive as thou wouldst be
  - E’en forgiven now by me.
  - In the solemn faith of prayer
  - Cast upon me all thy care,
  - And my Spirit’s grace shall be
  - Like a fountain unto thee.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - At the throne I intercede;
  - For thee ever do I plead.
  - I have loved thee as thy friend,
  - With a love that cannot end.
  - Be obedient, I implore,
  - Prayerful, watchful evermore,
  - And be constant unto me,
  - That thy Savior I may be.
