  - On bended knees, with broken hearts,
  - We come before thee, Lord,
  - In secret and in open prayer—
  - Oh, wilt thou speak thy word?
  - Feed thou our souls, fill thou our hearts,
  - And bless our fast, we pray,
  - That we may feel thy presence here
  - And feast with thee today.

  lines:
  - We’ve shared our bread with those in need,
  - Relieved the suff’ring poor.
  - The stranger we have welcomed in—
  - Wilt thou impart thy store?
  - Feed thou our souls, fill thou our hearts,
  - And bless our fast, we pray,
  - That we may feel thy presence here
  - And feast with thee today.

  lines:
  - As witnesses, we gather here
  - To thank, and to attest
  - Of mercies and of miracles—
  - Oh, still our lives so bless!
  - Feed thou our souls, fill thou our hearts,
  - And bless our fast, we pray,
  - That we may feel thy presence here
  - And feast with thee today.
