verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Come, all whose souls are lighted
  - With wisdom from on high.
  - Shall we, to men benighted,
  - The lamp of life deny?
  - Salvation! Oh, salvation!
  - The joyful sound proclaim,
  - Till earth’s remotest nation
  - Has learned Messiah’s name.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - From Greenland’s icy mountains,
  - From India’s coral strand,
  - Where Afric’s sunny fountains
  - Roll down their golden sand,
  - From many an ancient river,
  - From many a palmy plain,
  - They call us to deliver
  - Their land from error’s chain.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Go tell, ye winds, his story,
  - And mighty waters, roll,
  - Till, like a sea of glory,
  - It spreads from pole to pole;
  - Till o’er our ransomed nature
  - The Lamb, for sinners slain,
  - Redeemer, King, Creator
  - In bliss returns to reign.
