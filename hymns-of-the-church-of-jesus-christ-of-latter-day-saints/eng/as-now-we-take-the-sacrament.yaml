  - As now we take the sacrament,
  - Our thoughts are turned to thee,
  - Thou Son of God, who lived for us,
  - Then died on Calvary.
  - We contemplate thy lasting grace,
  - Thy boundless charity;
  - To us the gift of life was giv’n
  - For all eternity.

  lines:
  - As now our minds review the past,
  - We know we must repent;
  - The way to thee is righteousness—
  - The way thy life was spent.
  - Forgiveness is a gift from thee
  - We seek with pure intent.
  - With hands now pledged to do thy work,
  - We take the sacrament.

  lines:
  - As now we praise thy name with song,
  - The blessings of this day
  - Will linger in our thankful hearts,
  - And silently we pray
  - For courage to accept thy will,
  - To listen and obey.
  - We love thee, Lord; our hearts are full.
  - We’ll walk thy chosen way.
