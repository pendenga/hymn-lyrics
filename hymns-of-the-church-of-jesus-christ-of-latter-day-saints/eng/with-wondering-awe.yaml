  lines:
  - With wond’ring awe the wisemen saw
  - The star in heaven springing,
  - And with delight, in peaceful night,
  - They heard the angels singing:
  - Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna to his name!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - By light of star they traveled far
  - To seek the lowly manger,
  - A humble bed wherein was laid
  - The wondrous little Stranger.
  - Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna to his name!

  lines:
  - And still is found, the world around,
  - The old and hallowed story,
  - And still is sung in ev’ry tongue
  - The angels’ song of glory:
  - Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna to his name!

  lines:
  - The heav’nly star its rays afar
  - On ev’ry land is throwing,
  - And shall not cease till holy peace
  - In all the earth is growing.
  - Hosanna, hosanna, hosanna to his name!
