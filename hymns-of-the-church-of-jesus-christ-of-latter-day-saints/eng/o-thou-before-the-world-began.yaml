marking: Prayerfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - O thou, before the world began,
  - Ordained a sacrifice for man,
  - And by th’eternal Spirit made
  - An off’ring in the sinner’s stead;
  - Our everlasting Priest art thou,
  - Pleading thy death for sinners now.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Thy off’ring still continues new
  - Before the righteous Father’s view.
  - Thyself the Lamb forever slain;
  - Thy priesthood doth unchanged remain.
  - Thy years, O God, can never fail,
  - Nor thy blest work within the veil.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Oh, that our faith may never move
  - But stand unshaken as thy love,
  - Sure evidence of things unseen;
  - Now let it pass the years between
  - And view thee bleeding on the tree:
  - My Lord, my God, who dies for me.
