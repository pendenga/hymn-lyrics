- number: 1
  lines:
  - Because I have been given much,
  - I too must give;
  - Because of thy great bounty Lord,
  - Each day I live;
  - I shall divide my gifts from thee
  - With every brother that I see
  - Who has the need of help from me.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Because I have been sheltered, fed
  - By thy good care;
  - I cannot see another’s lack and I not share;
  - My glowing fire, my loaf of bread,
  - my roof's safe shelter overhead
  - That he too may be comforted.

  lines:
  - Because I have been blessed by
  - thy great love dear Lord;
  - I’ll share thy love again
  - According to thy word;
  - I shall give love to those in need,
  - I’ll show that love by word and deed;
  - Thus shall my thanks be thanks in deed.
