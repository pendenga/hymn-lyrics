- number: 1
  lines:
  - Firm as the mountains around us,
  - Stalwart and brave we stand
  - On the rock our fathers planted
  - For us in this goodly land—
  - The rock of honor and virtue,
  - Of faith in the living God.
  - They raised his banner triumphant—
  - Over the desert sod.
  - And we hear the desert singing:
  - Carry on, carry on, carry on!
  - Hills and vales and mountains ringing:
  - Carry on, carry on, carry on!
  - Holding aloft our colors,
  - We march in the glorious dawn.
  - O youth of the noble birthright,
  - Carry on, carry on, carry on!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - We’ll build on the rock they planted
  - A palace to the King.
  - Into its shining corridors
  - Our songs of praise we’ll bring,
  - For the heritage they left us,
  - Not of gold or of worldly wealth,
  - But a blessing everlasting
  - Of love and joy and health.
  - And we hear the desert singing:
  - Carry on, carry on, carry on!
  - Hills and vales and mountains ringing:
  - Carry on, carry on, carry on!
  - Holding aloft our colors,
  - We march in the glorious dawn.
  - O youth of the noble birthright,
  - Carry on, carry on, carry on!
