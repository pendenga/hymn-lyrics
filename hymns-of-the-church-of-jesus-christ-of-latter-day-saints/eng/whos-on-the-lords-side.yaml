  - We serve the living God,
  - And want his foes to know
  - That, if but few, we’re great;
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - We’re going on to win;
  - No fear must blanch the brow.
  - The Lord of Hosts is ours;
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?

  lines:
  - The stone cut without hands
  - To fill the earth must grow.
  - Who’ll help to roll it on?
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - Our ensign to the world
  - Is floating proudly now.
  - No coward bears our flag;
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - Now is the time to show.

  lines:
  - The pow’rs of earth and hell
  - In rage direct the blow
  - That’s aimed to crush the work;
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - Truth, life, and liberty,
  - Freedom from death and woe,
  - Are stakes we’re fighting for;
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
  - Now is the time to show.
  - We ask it fearlessly:
  - Who’s on the Lord’s side? Who?
