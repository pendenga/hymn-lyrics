  - His love is great; he died for us.
  - Shall we ungrateful be,
  - Since he has marked a road to bliss
  - And said, “Come, follow me,”

  - And said, “Come, follow me”?

  - The straight and narrow way we’ve found!
  - Then let us travel on,
  - Till we, in the celestial world,

  - Shall meet where Christ is gone.

  lines:
  - And there we’ll join the heav’nly choir
  - And sing his praise above,
  - While endless ages roll around,
  - Perfected by his love,
  - While endless ages roll around,
  - Perfected by his love.
