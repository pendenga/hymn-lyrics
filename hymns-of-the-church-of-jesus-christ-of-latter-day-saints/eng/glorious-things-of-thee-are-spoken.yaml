- number: 1
  lines:
  - Glorious things of thee are spoken,
  - Zion, city of our God!
  - He whose word cannot be broken
  - Chose thee for his own abode.
  - On the Rock of Ages founded,
  - What can shake our sure repose?
  - With salvation’s wall surrounded,
  - Thou may’st smile on all thy foes.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - See! the streams of living waters,
  - Springing from celestial love,
  - Well supply thy sons and daughters
  - And all fear of drought remove.
  - Round each habitation hov’ring,
  - See the cloud and fire appear
  - For a glory and a cov’ring,
  - Showing that the Lord is near.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Blest inhabitants of Zion,
  - Purchased by the Savior’s blood;
  - Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
  - Makes them kings and priests to God.
  - While in love his Saints he raises,
  - With himself to reign as King,
  - All, as priests, his solemn praises
  - For thank-off’rings freely bring.
