  lines:
  - We meet again as sisters
  - On this the Sabbath day
  - To worship God together,
  - To testify and pray.
  - Now may the Holy Spirit,
  - Descending like a dove,
  - Enlarge our minds with knowledge
  - And fill our hearts with love.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - We meet to plan our service
  - To neighbors now in need.
  - May charity and kindness
  - Inspire our ev’ry deed.
  - And as we use our talents
  - For good and noble ends,
  - May God be our companion
  - And angels be our friends.

  lines:
  - We meet to sing together
  - The praises of our Lord,
  - To seek our exaltation
  - According to his word.
  - To ev’ry gospel blessing
  - The Lord has turned the key,
  - That we, with heav’nly parents,
  - May sing eternally.
