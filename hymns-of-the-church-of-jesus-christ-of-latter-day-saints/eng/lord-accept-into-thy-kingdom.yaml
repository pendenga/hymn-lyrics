  - Lord, accept into thy kingdom
  - Each repentant, humbled one,
  - Born of water and the Spirit
  - In thy name, Beloved Son.
  - Let the Holy Ghost, descending,
  - Comfort, guide the path of youth,
  - Channel of all light and glory,
  - Key to vision, knowledge, truth.

  - Know ye not that he was holy?
  - Yet he witnessed unto men
  - That the way is straight and narrow
  - Leading unto God again.
  - Hark, glad tidings of salvation.
  - Hear his word, “Come, follow me
  - Unto glory in my kingdom,
  - Unto life eternally.”

  - Like the sound of rushing waters
  - In this day his word is said:
  - Holy ordinance of mercy
  - For the living and the dead!
  - Let your hearts rejoice in gladness!
  - Let the earth break forth and sing!
  - Let the dead speak praising anthems
  - To our God, eternal King!
