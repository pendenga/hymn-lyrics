title: Oh Say What Is Truth
marking: Firmly
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Oh say, what is truth? ’Tis the fairest gem
  - That the riches of worlds can produce,
  - And priceless the value of truth will be when
  - The proud monarch’s costliest diadem
  - Is counted but dross and refuse.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Yes, say, what is truth? ’Tis the brightest prize
  - To which mortals or Gods can aspire.
  - Go search in the depths where it glittering lies,
  - Or ascend in pursuit to the loftiest skies:
  - ’Tis an aim for the noblest desire.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - The sceptre may fall from the despot’s grasp
  - When with winds of stern justice he copes.
  - But the pillar of truth will endure to the last,
  - And its firm-rooted bulwarks outstand the rude blast
  - And the wreck of the fell tyrant’s hopes.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Then say, what is truth? ’Tis the last and the first,
  - For the limits of time it steps o’er.
  - Tho the heavens depart and the earth’s fountains burst,
  - Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,
  - Eternal, unchanged, evermore.
