  - Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side;
  - With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain.
  - Leave to thy God to order and provide;
  - In ev’ry change he faithful will remain.

  - Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.

  lines:
  - Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake
  - To guide the future as he has the past.
  - Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake;
  - All now mysterious shall be bright at last.
  - Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know
  - His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.

  lines:
  - Be still, my soul: The hour is hast’ning on
  - When we shall be forever with the Lord,
  - When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,
  - Sorrow forgot, love’s purest joys restored.
  - Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,
  - All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
