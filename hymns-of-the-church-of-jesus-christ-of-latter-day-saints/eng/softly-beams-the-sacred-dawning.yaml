  - Softly beams the sacred dawning
  - Of the great millennial morn,
  - And to Saints gives welcome warning
  - That the day is hast’ning on,
  - That the day is hast’ning on.

  - Splendid, rising o’er the mountains,
  - Glowing with celestial cheer,
  - Streaming from eternal fountains,
  - Rays of living light appear,
  - Rays of living light appear.

  lines:
  - Swiftly flee the clouds of darkness;
  - Speedily the mists retire;
  - Nature’s universal blackness
  - Is consumed by heav’nly fire,
  - Is consumed by heav’nly fire.

  lines:
  - Yea, the fair sabbatic era,
  - When the world will be at rest,
  - Rapidly is drawing nearer;
  - Then all Israel will be blest,
  - Then all Israel will be blest.
