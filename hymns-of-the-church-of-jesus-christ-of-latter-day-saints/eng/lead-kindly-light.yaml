- number: 1
  lines:
  - Lead, kindly Light, amid th’encircling gloom;
  - Lead thou me on!
  - The night is dark, and I am far from home;
  - Lead thou me on!
  - Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
  - The distant scene—one step enough for me.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - I was not ever thus, nor pray’d that thou
  - Shouldst lead me on.
  - I loved to choose and see my path; but now,
  - Lead thou me on!
  - I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,
  - Pride ruled my will. Remember not past years.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - So long thy pow’r hath blest me, sure it still
  - Will lead me on
  - O’er moor and fen, o’er crag and torrent, till
  - The night is gone.
  - And with the morn those angel faces smile,
  - Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile!
