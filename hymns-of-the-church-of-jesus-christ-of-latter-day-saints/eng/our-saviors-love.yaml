- number: 1
  lines:
  - Our Savior’s love
  - Shines like the sun with perfect light,
  - As from above
  - It breaks thru clouds of strife.
  - Lighting our way,
  - It leads us back into his sight,
  - Where we may stay
  - To share eternal life.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The Spirit, voice
  - Of goodness, whispers to our hearts
  - A better choice
  - Than evil’s anguished cries.
  - Loud may the sound
  - Of hope ring till all doubt departs,
  - And we are bound
  - To him by loving ties.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Our Father, God
  - Of all creation, hear us pray
  - In rev’rence, awed
  - By thy Son’s sacrifice.
  - Praises we sing.
  - We love thy law; we will obey.
  - Our heav’nly King,
  - In thee our hearts rejoice.
