  lines:
  - Now thank we all our God
  - With hearts and hands and voices,
  - Who wondrous things hath done,
  - In whom his earth rejoices;
  - Who, from our mothers’ arms,
  - Hath blessed us on our way
  - With countless gifts of love
  - And still is ours today.

  lines:
  - Oh, may our bounteous God
  - Through all our life be near us,
  - With ever-joyful hearts
  - And blessed peace to cheer us,
  - And keep us in his love,
  - And guide us day and night,
  - And free us from all ills,
  - Protect us by his might.
