  lines:
  - Ere you left your room this morning,
  - Did you think to pray?
  - In the name of Christ, our Savior,
  - Did you sue for loving favor
  - As a shield today?
  - Oh, how praying rests the weary!
  - Prayer will change the night to day.
  - So, when life gets dark and dreary,
  - Don’t forget to pray.

  lines:
  - When your heart was filled with anger,
  - Did you think to pray?
  - Did you plead for grace, my brother,
  - That you might forgive another
  - Who had crossed your way?
  - Oh, how praying rests the weary!
  - Prayer will change the night to day.
  - So, when life gets dark and dreary,
  - Don’t forget to pray.

  lines:
  - When sore trials came upon you,
  - Did you think to pray?
  - When your soul was full of sorrow,
  - Balm of Gilead did you borrow
  - At the gates of day?
  - Oh, how praying rests the weary!
  - Prayer will change the night to day.
  - So, when life gets dark and dreary,
  - Don’t forget to pray.
