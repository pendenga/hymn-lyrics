  - Called to serve Him, heav’nly King of glory,
  - Chosen e’er to witness for his name,
  - Far and wide we tell the Father’s story,
  - Far and wide his love proclaim.
  - Onward, ever onward, as we glory in his name;
  - Onward, ever onward, as we glory in his name;
  - Forward, pressing forward, as a triumph song we sing.
  - God our strength will be; press forward ever,
  - Called to serve our King.

  lines:
  - Called to know the richness of his blessing—
  - Sons and daughters, children of a King—
  - Glad of heart, his holy name confessing,
  - Praises unto him we bring.
  - Onward, ever onward, as we glory in his name;
  - Onward, ever onward, as we glory in his name;
  - Forward, pressing forward, as a triumph song we sing.
  - God our strength will be; press forward ever,
  - Called to serve our King.
