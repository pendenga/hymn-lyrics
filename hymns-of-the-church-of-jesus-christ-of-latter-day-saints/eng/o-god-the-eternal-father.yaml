- number: 1
  lines:
  - O God, th’Eternal Father,
  - Who dwells amid the sky,
  - In Jesus’ name we ask thee
  - To bless and sanctify,
  - If we are pure before thee,
  - This bread and cup of wine,
  - That we may all remember
  - That offering divine—
- number: 2
  lines:
  - That sacred, holy off’ring,
  - By man least understood,
  - To have our sins remitted
  - And take his flesh and blood,
  - That we may ever witness
  - The suff’ring of thy Son,
  - And always have his Spirit
  - To make our hearts as one.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - When Jesus, the Anointed,
  - Descended from above
  - And gave himself a ransom
  - To win our souls with love—
  - With no apparent beauty,
  - That man should him desire—
  - He was the promised Savior,
  - To purify with fire.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - How infinite that wisdom,
  - The plan of holiness,
  - That made salvation perfect
  - And veiled the Lord in flesh,
  - To walk upon his footstool
  - And be like man, almost,
  - In his exalted station,
  - And die, or all was lost.
