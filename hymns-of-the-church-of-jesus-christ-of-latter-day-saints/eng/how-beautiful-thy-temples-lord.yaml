- number: 1
  lines:
  - How beautiful thy temples, Lord!
  - Each one a sacred shrine,
  - Where faithful Saints, with one accord,
  - Engage in work divine.
  - How beautiful some aid to give
  - To dear ones we call dead,
  - But who indeed as spirits live;
  - They’ve only gone ahead.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - How beautiful thy message, Lord,
  - The gospel, pure and true,
  - In these our days to earth restored
  - And taught to men anew.
  - How beautiful its faith and hope;
  - All mankind it would save,
  - Including in its aim and scope
  - The souls beyond the grave.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - How beautiful thy promise, Lord,
  - That we may grow in truth,
  - And live, exalted by thy word,
  - In endless, glorious youth.
  - With loved ones sealed in holiness
  - By sacred temple rites,
  - Worlds without end we may progress
  - From heights to greater heights.
