marking: Brightly
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Have I done any good in the world today?
  - Have I helped anyone in need?
  - Have I cheered up the sad and made someone feel glad?
  - If not, I have failed indeed.
  - Has anyone’s burden been lighter today
  - Because I was willing to share?
  - Have the sick and the weary been helped on their way?
  - When they needed my help was I there?
  - Then wake up and do something more
  - Than dream of your mansion above.
  - Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,
  - A blessing of duty and love.

  lines:
  - There are chances for work all around just now,
  - Opportunities right in our way.
  - Do not let them pass by, saying, “Sometime I’ll try,”
  - But go and do something today.
  - ’Tis noble of man to work and to give;
  - Love’s labor has merit alone.
  - Only he who does something helps others to live.
  - To God each good work will be known.
  - Then wake up and do something more
  - Than dream of your mansion above.
  - Doing good is a pleasure, a joy beyond measure,
  - A blessing of duty and love.
