verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Brethren, pow’r by earthly standards
  - Comes by rank or wealth or sword;
  - But the pow’r above all others
  - Is the priesthood of our Lord.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - It is ours, the total armor—
  - Priesthood held by Christ, our Lord—
  - If, as brethren, we are worthy
  - Of the Spirit’s whispered word.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Let us venture forth in freedom
  - With the priesthood as our guide—
  - Deacons, teachers, priests, and elders,
  - Seeking virtue side by side.
  - May be sung without accompaniment as a round in unison by beginning every two measures.
