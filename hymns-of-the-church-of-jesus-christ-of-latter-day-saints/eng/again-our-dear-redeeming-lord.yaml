- number: 1
  lines:
  - Again, our dear redeeming Lord,
  - We meet in thy beloved name,
  - While from the fountains of thy love
  - Thy Spirit kindles like a flame.
  - For all the anguish of thy soul,
  - For thy great gift so full and free,
  - With grateful hearts all penitent,
  - Dear Lord, we do remember thee.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - In token of thy bleeding flesh
  - And of thy blood so freely spent,
  - We meet around thy table now
  - And take thy holy sacrament.
  - We seek thy pardon, dearest Lord,
  - And may thy favor, too, be sent,
  - While in our hearts we turn to thee,
  - Renewed in faith and covenant.
