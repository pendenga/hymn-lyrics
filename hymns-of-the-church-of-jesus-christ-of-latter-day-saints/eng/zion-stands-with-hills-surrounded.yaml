verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Zion stands with hill surrounded—
  - Zion, kept by pow’r divine.
  - All her foes shall be confounded,
  - Though the world in arms combine.
  - Happy Zion, Happy Zion,
  - What a favored lot is thine!
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Ev’ry human tie may perish,
  - Friend to friend unfaithful prove,
  - Mothers cease their own to cherish,
  - Heav’n and earth at last remove.
  - But no changes, But no changes
  - Can attend Jehovah’s love.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - In the furnace God may prove thee,
  - Thence to bring thee forth more bright,
  - But can never cease to love thee;
  - Thou art precious in his sight.
  - God is with thee, God is with thee;
  - Thou shalt triumph in his might.
