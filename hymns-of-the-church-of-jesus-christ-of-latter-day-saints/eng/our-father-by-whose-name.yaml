  - Our Father, by whose name all fatherhood is known,

  - With constant love as sentinel,
  - The homes in which thy people dwell.

  - As thou thy Child didst fill with wisdom, love, and might,
  - To know and do thy will and teach thy ways aright,
  - Our children bless, in ev’ry place,
  - That they may all behold thy face,
  - And, knowing thee, may grow in grace.

  - May thy strong Spirit bind our hearts in unity,
  - And help us each to find the love from self set free.
  - In all our hearts such love increase,
  - That ev’ry home, by this release,
  - May be the dwelling place of peace.
