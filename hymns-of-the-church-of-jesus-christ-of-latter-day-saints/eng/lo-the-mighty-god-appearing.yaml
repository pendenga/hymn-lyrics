  - Lo, the mighty God appearing!
  - From on high Jehovah speaks!
  - Eastern lands the summons hearing,
  - O’er the west his thunder breaks.
  - Earth behold him! Earth behold him!
  - Universal nature shakes.
  - Earth behold him! Earth behold him!
  - Universal nature shakes.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Zion, all its light unfolding,
  - God in glory shall display.
  - Lo! he comes! nor silence holding;
  - Fire and clouds prepare his way.
  - Tempests round him! Tempests round him!
  - Hasten on the dreadful day.
  - Tempests round him! Tempests round him!
  - Hasten on the dreadful day.

  lines:
  - To the heav’ns his voice ascending,
  - To the earth beneath he cries.
  - Souls immortal, now descending,
  - Let their sleeping dust arise!
  - Rise to judgment! Rise to judgment!
  - Let thy throne adorn the skies.
  - Rise to judgment! Rise to judgment!
  - Let thy throne adorn the skies.

  lines:
  - Now the heav’ns on high adore him
  - And his righteousness declare.
  - Sinners perish from before him,
  - But his Saints his mercies share.
  - Just his judgments! Just his judgments!
  - God, himself the judge, is there.
  - Just his judgments! Just his judgments!
  - God, himself the judge, is there.
