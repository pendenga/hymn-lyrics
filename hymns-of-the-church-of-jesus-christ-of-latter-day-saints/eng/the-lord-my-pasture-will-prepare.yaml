marking: Gently
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - The Lord my pasture will prepare
  - And feed me with a shepherd’s care.
  - His presence will my want supply
  - And guard me with a watchful eye.
  - My noonday walks he will attend
  - And all my silent midnight hours defend.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - When in the sultry glebe I faint,
  - Or on the thirsty mountain pant,
  - To fertile vales and dewy meads
  - My weary, wand’ring steps he leads,
  - Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,
  - Amid the cooling verdant landscape flow.
