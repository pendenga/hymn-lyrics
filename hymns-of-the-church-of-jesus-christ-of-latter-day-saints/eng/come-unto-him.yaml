title: Come unto Him
marking: Thoughtfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - I wander through the still of night,
  - When solitude is ev’rywhere—
  - Alone, beneath the starry light,
  - And yet I know that God is there.
  - I kneel upon the grass and pray;
  - An answer comes without a voice.
  - It takes my burden all away
  - And makes my aching heart rejoice.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - When I am filled with strong desire
  - And ask a boon of him, I see
  - No miracle of living fire,
  - But what I ask flows into me.
  - And when the tempest rages high
  - I feel no arm around me thrust,
  - But ev’ry storm goes rolling by
  - When I repose in him my trust.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - It matters not what may befall,
  - What threat’ning hand hangs over me;
  - He is my rampart through it all,
  - My refuge from mine enemy.
  - Come unto him all ye depressed,
  - Ye erring souls whose eyes are dim,
  - Ye weary ones who long for rest.
  - Come unto him! Come unto him!
