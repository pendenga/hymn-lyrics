- number: 1
  lines:
  - Behold, the mountain of the Lord
  - In latter days shall rise
  - On mountaintops, above the hills,
  - And draw the wond’ring eyes.
  - To this shall joyful nations come;
  - All tribes and tongues shall flow.
  - “Up to the hill of God,” they’ll say,
  - “And to his house we’ll go.”
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The rays that shine from Zion’s hill
  - Shall lighten ev’ry land;
  - The King who reigns in Salem’s tow’r
  - Shall all the world command.
  - Among the nations he shall judge;
  - His judgments truth shall guide;
  - His scepter shall protect the just
  - And quell the sinner’s pride.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - No strife shall rage, nor hostile feuds
  - Disturb those peaceful years;
  - To plowshares men shall beat their swords,
  - To pruning hooks their spears.
  - No longer host encount’ring host
  - Shall crowds of slain deplore;
  - They’ll hang the trumpet in the hall
  - And study war no more.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Come, then, O house of Jacob, come,
  - To worship at His shrine,
  - And, walking in the light of God,
  - With holy beauties shine.
  - Come, then, O house of Jacob, come,
  - To worship at His shrine,
  - And, walking in the light of God,
  - With holy beauties shine.
