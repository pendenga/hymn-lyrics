  - We’ll keep love burning bright.
  - Serving Him with cheerful hearts,

  - Praying daily in our home,
  - We’ll feel His love divine;
  - Searching scriptures faithfully,
  - We’ll nourish heart and mind.

  - “Father, help us find the way
  - Leading to our home in heaven,
  - Where we long to stay.”
