  - Sons of Michael, he approaches!

  - Spreading over sea and main.

  - Sons of Michael, ’tis his chariot
  - Rolls its burning wheels along!
  - Raise aloft your voices million
  - In a torrent pow’r of song.

  - Raise sweet melodies aloft!

  - Mother of our generations,
  - Glorious by great Michael’s side,
  - Take thy children’s adoration;
  - Endless with thy seed abide.
  - Lo! to greet thee now advance
  - Thousands in the glorious dance!

  lines:
  - Raise a chorus, sons of Michael,
  - Like old ocean’s roaring swell,
  - Till the mighty acclamation
  - Thru rebounding space doth tell
  - That the ancient one doth reign
  - In his Father’s house again!
