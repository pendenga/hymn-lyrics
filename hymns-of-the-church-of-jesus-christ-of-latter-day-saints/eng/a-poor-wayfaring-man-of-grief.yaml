- number: 1
  lines:
  - A poor wayfaring Man of grief
  - Hath often crossed me on my way,
  - Who sued so humbly for relief
  - That I could never answer nay.
  - I had not pow’r to ask his name,
  - Whereto he went, or whence he came;
  - Yet there was something in his eye
  - That won my love; I knew not why.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Once, when my scanty meal was spread,
  - He entered; not a word he spake,
  - Just perishing for want of bread.
  - I gave him all; he blessed it, brake,
  - And ate, but gave me part again.
  - Mine was an angel’s portion then,
  - For while I fed with eager haste,
  - The crust was manna to my taste.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - I spied him where a fountain burst
  - Clear from the rock; his strength was gone.
  - The heedless water mocked his thirst;
  - He heard it, saw it hurrying on.
  - I ran and raised the suff’rer up;
  - Thrice from the stream he drained my cup,
  - Dipped and returned it running o’er;
  - I drank and never thirsted more.
- number: 4
  optional: true
  lines:
  - ’Twas night; the floods were out; it blew
  - A winter hurricane aloof.
  - I heard his voice abroad and flew
  - To bid him welcome to my roof.
  - I warmed and clothed and cheered my guest
  - And laid him on my couch to rest,
  - Then made the earth my bed and seemed
  - In Eden’s garden while I dreamed.
- number: 5
  optional: true
  lines:
  - Stript, wounded, beaten nigh to death,
  - I found him by the highway side.
  - I roused his pulse, brought back his breath,
  - Revived his spirit, and supplied
  - Wine, oil, refreshment—he was healed.
  - I had myself a wound concealed,
  - But from that hour forgot the smart,
  - And peace bound up my broken heart.
- number: 6
  optional: true
  lines:
  - In pris’n I saw him next, condemned
  - To meet a traitor’s doom at morn.
  - The tide of lying tongues I stemmed,
  - And honored him ’mid shame and scorn.
  - My friendship’s utmost zeal to try,
  - He asked if I for him would die.
  - The flesh was weak; my blood ran chill,
  - But my free spirit cried, “I will!”
- number: 7
  optional: true
  lines:
  - Then in a moment to my view
  - The stranger started from disguise.
  - The tokens in his hands I knew;
  - The Savior stood before mine eyes.
  - He spake, and my poor name he named,
  - “Of me thou hast not been ashamed.
  - These deeds shall thy memorial be;
  - Fear not, thou didst them unto me.”
