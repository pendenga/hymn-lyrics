  - In ev’ry land, in ev’ry tongue, our prophet will be heard;
  - How swiftly round the world his voice reveals the gospel word!
  - The sacred message that he brings will witness and agree
  - With ev’ry prophet called of God throughout earth’s history.

  - Hosanna! Let our praise ascend unto the Savior’s throne;
  - Rejoice! The prophet has confirmed that by Him we are known.
  - Attend, ye earth! The prophet speaks; come listen and obey.
  - He is the man who holds the keys of priesthood pow’r today.
