  - Come, O thou King of Kings!

  - Let Israel now be gathered home.

  - Come, make an end to sin,
  - And cleanse the earth by fire,
  - And righteousness bring in,
  - That Saints may tune the lyre
  - With songs of joy, a happier strain,
  - To welcome in thy peaceful reign.

  lines:
  - Hosannas now shall sound
  - From all the ransomed throng,
  - And glory echo round
  - A new triumphal song;
  - The wide expanse of heaven fill
  - With anthems sweet from Zion’s hill.

  lines:
  - Hail! Prince of life and peace!
  - Thrice welcome to thy throne!
  - While all the chosen race
  - Their Lord and Savior own,
  - The heathen nations bow the knee,
  - And ev’ry tongue sounds praise to thee.
