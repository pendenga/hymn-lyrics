- number: 1
  lines:
  - I saw a mighty angel fly;
  - To earth he bent his way,
  - A message bearing from on high
  - To cheer the sons of day.
  - Truth is the message which he bears,
  - The gospel’s joyful sound,
  - To calm our doubts, to chase our fears,
  - And make our joys abound.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - He cries, and with a mighty voice;
  - Ye nations lend an ear,
  - And isles and continents rejoice:
  - The great Redeemer’s near!
  - He cries; let ev’ry ear attend,
  - And thrones and empires all!
  - Fear God, and make the Lord your friend,
  - The King, the Lord of all!
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Fear God, who made the water pure,
  - The heavens, sea, and land.
  - His judgment will be swift and sure;
  - The day is nigh at hand.
  - Then, all ye people, worship God;
  - Give glory to his name!
  - To spread these tidings far abroad
  - The holy angel came.
