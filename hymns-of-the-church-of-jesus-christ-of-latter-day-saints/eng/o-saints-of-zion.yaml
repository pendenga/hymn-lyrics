  - O Saints of Zion, hear the voice
  - Of Him from courts on high.

  - In majesty divine.

  - Entreat the Lord in humble prayer
  - That all the sons of men
  - His righteous kingdom will receive
  - And shout the glad “amen.”

  - Make known the wondrous words of truth
  - Revealed again to man.

  - Behold, the glory of the Lord
  - Sets Zion’s mount aglow,
  - For Zion is an ensign pure;
  - All nations to her flow.
  - O Saints of Zion, tread the paths
  - Your faithful fathers trod.
  - Lift up your hearts in gratitude
  - And serve the living God!
