- number: 1
  lines:
  - I will not doubt, I will not fear;
  - God’s love and strength are always near.
  - His promised gift helps me to find
  - An inner strength and peace of mind.
  - I give the Father willingly
  - My trust, my prayers, humility.
  - His Spirit guides; his love assures
  - That fear departs when faith endures.
