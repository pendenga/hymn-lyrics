  - I heard the bells on Christmas day
  - Their old familiar carols play,
  - And wild and sweet the words repeat
  - Of peace on earth, good will to men.

  lines:
  - I thought how, as the day had come,
  - The belfries of all Christendom
  - Had rolled along th’unbroken song
  - Of peace on earth, good will to men.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - And in despair I bowed my head:
  - “There is no peace on earth,” I said,
  - “For hate is strong and mocks the song
  - Of peace on earth, good will to men.”

  lines:
  - Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:
  - “God is not dead, nor doth he sleep;
  - The wrong shall fail, the right prevail,
  - With peace on earth, good will to men.”
- number: 5
  lines:
  - Till, ringing, singing, on its way,
  - The world revolved from night to day,
  - A voice, a chime, a chant sublime,
  - Of peace on earth, good will to men!
