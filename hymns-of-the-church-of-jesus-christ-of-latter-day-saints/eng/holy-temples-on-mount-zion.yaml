  lines:
  - Holy temples on Mount Zion
  - In a lofty splendor shine,
  - Avenues to exaltation,
  - Symbols of a love divine.
  - And their kindly portals beckon
  - To serenity and prayer,
  - Valiant children of the promise,
  - Pledged to sacred service there.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Merciful and gracious Father,
  - Purify our hearts, we pray;
  - Bless our mission of redemption
  - In thy hallowed house each day,
  - Till at length our faithful kindred,
  - Sealed with us eternally
  - In celestial bonds of union,
  - Sing hosannas unto thee.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Sing aloud, ye heav’nly chorus,
  - Anthems of eternal praise
  - To the glorious King Immanuel!
  - Sing with Saints of latter days!
  - Let the mountains shout for gladness,
  - And the valleys joyful be,
  - While the stars acclaim in rapture,
  - For the prisoners shall go free.
