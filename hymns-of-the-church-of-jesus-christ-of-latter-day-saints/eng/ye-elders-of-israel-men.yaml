  lines:
  - Ye elders of Israel, come join now with me
  - And seek out the righteous, where’er they may be—
  - In desert, on mountain, on land, or on sea—
  - And bring them to Zion, the pure and the free.
  - O Babylon, O Babylon, we bid thee farewell;
  - We’re going to the mountains of Ephraim to dwell.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The harvest is great, and the lab’rers are few;
  - But if we’re united, we all things can do.
  - We’ll gather the wheat from the midst of the tares
  - And bring them from bondage, from sorrows and snares.
  - O Babylon, O Babylon, we bid thee farewell;
  - We’re going to the mountains of Ephraim to dwell.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - We’ll go to the poor, like our Captain of old,
  - And visit the weary, the hungry, and cold;
  - We’ll cheer up their hearts with the news that he bore
  - And point them to Zion and life evermore.
  - O Babylon, O Babylon, we bid thee farewell;
  - We’re going to the mountains of Ephraim to dwell.
