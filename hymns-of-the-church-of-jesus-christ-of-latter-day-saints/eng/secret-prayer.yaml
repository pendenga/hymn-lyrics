  - There is an hour of peace and rest,
  - Unmarred by earthly care;
  - ’Tis when before the Lord I go
  - And kneel in secret prayer.
  - May my heart be turned to pray,
  - Pray in secret day by day,
  - That this boon to mortals giv’n
  - May unite my soul with heav’n.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - The straight and narrow way to heav’n,
  - Where angels bright and fair
  - Are singing to God’s praise, is found
  - Thru constant secret prayer.
  - May my heart be turned to pray,
  - Pray in secret day by day,
  - That this boon to mortals giv’n
  - May unite my soul with heav’n.

  lines:
  - When sailing on life’s stormy sea,
  - ’Mid billows of despair,
  - ’Tis solace to my soul to know
  - God hears my secret prayer.
  - May my heart be turned to pray,
  - Pray in secret day by day,
  - That this boon to mortals giv’n
  - May unite my soul with heav’n.

  lines:
  - When thorns are strewn along my path,
  - And foes my feet ensnare,
  - My Savior to my aid will come,
  - If sought in secret prayer.
  - May my heart be turned to pray,
  - Pray in secret day by day,
  - That this boon to mortals giv’n
  - May unite my soul with heav’n.
