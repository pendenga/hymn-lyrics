  - The day dawn is breaking, the world is awaking,
  - The clouds of night’s darkness are fleeing away.
  - The worldwide commotion, from ocean to ocean,
  - Now heralds the time of the beautiful day.
  - Beautiful day of peace and rest,
  - Bright be thy dawn from east to west.
  - Hail to thine earliest welcome ray,
  - Beautiful, bright, millennial day.

  lines:
  - In many a temple the Saints will assemble
  - And labor as saviors of dear ones away.
  - Then happy reunion and sweetest communion
  - We’ll have with our friends in the beautiful day.
  - Beautiful day of peace and rest,
  - Bright be thy dawn from east to west.
  - Hail to thine earliest welcome ray,
  - Beautiful, bright, millennial day.

  lines:
  - Still let us be doing, our lessons reviewing,
  - Which God has revealed for our walk in his way;
  - And then, wondrous story, the Lord in his glory
  - Will come in his pow’r in the beautiful day.
  - Beautiful day of peace and rest,
  - Bright be thy dawn from east to west.
  - Hail to thine earliest welcome ray,
  - Beautiful, bright, millennial day.

  lines:
  - Then pure and supernal, our friendship eternal,
  - With Jesus we’ll live and his counsels obey
  - Until ev’ry nation will join in salvation
  - And worship the Lord of the beautiful day.
  - Beautiful day of peace and rest,
  - Bright be thy dawn from east to west.
  - Hail to thine earliest welcome ray,
  - Beautiful, bright, millennial day.
