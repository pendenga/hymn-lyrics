  - In remembrance of thy suff’ring,
  - Lord, these emblems we partake,
  - When thyself thou gav’st an off’ring,
  - Dying for the sinner’s sake.
  - We’ve forgiven as thou biddest
  - All who’ve trespassed against us.
  - Lord, forgive, as we’ve forgiven,
  - All thou seest amiss in us.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Purify our hearts, our Savior;
  - Let us go not far astray,
  - That we may be counted worthy
  - Of thy Spirit day by day.
  - When temptations are before us,
  - Give us strength to overcome.
  - Always guard us in our wand’rings
  - Till we leave our earthly home.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - When thou comest in thy glory
  - To this earth to rule and reign,
  - And with faithful ones partakest
  - Of the bread and wine again,
  - May we be among the number
  - Worthy to surround the board,
  - And partake anew the emblems
  - Of the suff’rings of our Lord.
