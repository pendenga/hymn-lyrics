  - How firm a foundation, ye Saints of the Lord,
  - Is laid for your faith in his excellent word!

  - Who unto the Savior, who unto the Savior,
  - Who unto the Savior for refuge have fled?
- number: 2
  lines:
  - In ev’ry condition—in sickness, in health,
  - In poverty’s vale or abounding in wealth,
  - At home or abroad, on the land or the sea—
  - As thy days may demand, as thy days may demand,
  - As thy days may demand, so thy succor shall be.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Fear not, I am with thee; oh, be not dismayed,
  - For I am thy God and will still give thee aid.
  - I’ll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
  - Upheld by my righteous, upheld by my righteous,
  - Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
  - The rivers of sorrow shall not thee o’erflow,
  - For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
  - And sanctify to thee, and sanctify to thee,
  - And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.
- number: 5
  lines:
  - When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
  - My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply.
  - The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
  - Thy dross to consume, thy dross to consume,
  - Thy dross to consume and thy gold to refine.
- number: 6
  lines:
  - E’en down to old age, all my people shall prove
  - My sov’reign, eternal, unchangeable love;
  - And then, when gray hair shall their temples adorn,
  - Like lambs shall they still, like lambs shall they still,
  - Like lambs shall they still in my bosom be borne.
- number: 7
  lines:
  - The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose
  - I will not, I cannot, desert to his foes;
  - That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
  - I’ll never, no never, I’ll never, no never,
  - I’ll never, no never, no never forsake!
