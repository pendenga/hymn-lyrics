- number: 1
  lines:
  - You can make the pathway bright,
  - Fill the soul with heaven’s light,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart;
  - Turning darkness into day,
  - As the shadows fly away,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart,
  - You can send a shining ray
  - That will turn the night to day;
  - And your cares will all depart,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - You can speak the gentle word
  - To the heart with anger stirred,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart;
  - Tho it seems a little thing,
  - It will heaven’s blessings bring,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart,
  - You can send a shining ray
  - That will turn the night to day;
  - And your cares will all depart,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - You can do a kindly deed
  - To your neighbor in his need,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart;
  - And his burden you will share
  - As you lift his load of care,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart,
  - You can send a shining ray
  - That will turn the night to day;
  - And your cares will all depart,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.

  lines:
  - You can live a happy life
  - In this world of toil and strife,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart;
  - And your soul will glow with love
  - From the perfect Light above,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart,
  - You can send a shining ray
  - That will turn the night to day;
  - And your cares will all depart,
  - If there’s sunshine in your heart today.
