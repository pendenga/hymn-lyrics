  - Thanks for the Sabbath School. Hail to the day
  - When evil and error are fleeing away.
  - Thanks for our teachers who labor with care
  - That we in the light of the gospel may share.
  - Join in the jubilee; mingle in song.
  - Join in the joy of the Sabbath School throng.
  - Great be the glory of those who do right,
  - Who overcome evil, in good take delight.

  lines:
  - Now in the morning of life let us try
  - Each virtue to cherish, all vice to decry;
  - Strive with the noble in deeds that exalt,
  - And battle with energy each childish fault.
  - Join in the jubilee; mingle in song.
  - Join in the joy of the Sabbath School throng.
  - Great be the glory of those who do right,
  - Who overcome evil, in good take delight.

  lines:
  - May we endeavor through life’s devious way
  - To watch and be earnest, true wisdom display;
  - Try to o’ercome each temptation and snare,
  - Thereby full salvation eternally share.
  - Join in the jubilee; mingle in song.
  - Join in the joy of the Sabbath School throng.
  - Great be the glory of those who do right,
  - Who overcome evil, in good take delight.
