marking: Thoughtfully
verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - O Savior, thou who wearest
  - A crown of piercing thorn,
  - The pain thou meekly bearest,
  - Weigh’d down by grief and scorn.
  - The soldiers mock and flail thee;
  - For drink they give thee gall;
  - Upon the cross they nail thee
  - To die, O King of all.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - No creature is so lowly,
  - No sinner so depraved,
  - But feels thy presence holy
  - And thru thy love is saved.
  - Tho craven friends betray thee,
  - They feel thy love’s embrace;
  - The very foes who slay thee
  - Have access to thy grace.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Thy sacrifice transcended
  - The mortal law’s demand;
  - Thy mercy is extended
  - To ev’ry time and land.
  - No more can Satan harm us,
  - Tho long the fight may be,
  - Nor fear of death alarm us;
  - We live, O Lord, thru thee.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - What praises can we offer
  - To thank thee, Lord most high?
  - In our place thou didst suffer;
  - In our place thou didst die,
  - By heaven’s plan appointed,
  - To ransom us, our King.
  - O Jesus, the anointed,
  - To thee our love we bring!
