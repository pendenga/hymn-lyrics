verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - Jesus, Savior, pilot me
  - Over life’s tempestuous sea;
  - Unknown waves before me roll,
  - Hiding rock and treach’rous shoal.
  - Chart and compass came from thee;
  - Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - As a mother stills her child,
  - Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
  - Boist’rous waves obey thy will
  - When thou say’st to them, “Be still!”
  - Wondrous Sov’reign of the sea,
  - Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - When at last I near the shore,
  - And the fearful breakers roar
  - ’Twixt me and the peaceful rest,
  - Then, while leaning on thy breast,
  - May I hear thee say to me,
  - “Fear not; I will pilot thee.”
