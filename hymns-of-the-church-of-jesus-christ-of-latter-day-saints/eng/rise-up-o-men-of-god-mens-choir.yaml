  - Rise up, O men of God!
  - Have done with lesser things.
  - Give heart and soul and mind and strength
  - To serve the King of Kings.
  - Rise up, O men of God,
  - In one united throng.
  - Bring in the day of brotherhood
  - And end the night of wrong.
  - Rise up, O men of God!
  - Tread where his feet have trod.
  - As brothers of the Son of Man,
  - Rise up, O men of God!
  - Rise up! Rise up! Rise up!
