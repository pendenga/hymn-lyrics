  lines:
  - The voice of God again is heard.
  - The silence has been broken.
  - The curse of darkness is withdrawn.
  - The Lord from heav’n has spoken.
  - Rejoice, ye living and ye dead!
  - Rejoice, for your salvation
  - Begins anew this happy morn
  - Of final dispensation.

  lines:
  - O messengers of truth, go forth,
  - Proclaim the gospel story,
  - Go forth the nations to prepare
  - To greet the King of glory.
  - We shout hosanna, shout again,
  - Till all creation blending
  - Shall join in one great, grand amen
  - Of anthems never ending.
