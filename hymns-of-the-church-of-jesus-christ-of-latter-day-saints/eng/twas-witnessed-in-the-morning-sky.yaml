  lines:
  - ’Twas witnessed in the morning sky:
  - An angel earthward bound.
  - This messenger proclaimed anew
  - The gospel’s joyful sound.
  - In pow’r it would be preached on earth
  - By men of God ordained;
  - All men, all tongues, all nations would
  - Accept and praise his name.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - In ancient days the gospel plan
  - Was giv’n of God to men;
  - In latter days the gospel is
  - Restored to earth again.
  - By holy prophets long proclaimed,
  - By Saints and seers adored,
  - It speaks the everlasting truths
  - Of Jesus Christ, the Lord.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Apostles of a former day
  - To modern prophets came;
  - They brought the priesthood of our Lord
  - To bless the earth again.
  - The pow’rs of heav’n are opened wide
  - To men of God below;
  - The knowledge, gifts, and keys are ours,
  - All blessings to bestow.
