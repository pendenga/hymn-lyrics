  lines:
  - Up, awake, ye defenders of Zion!
  - The foe’s at the door of your homes;
  - Let each heart be the heart of a lion,
  - Unyielding and proud as he roams.
  - Remember the trials of Missouri;
  - Forget not the courage of Nauvoo.
  - When the enemy host is before you,
  - Stand firm and be faithful and true.
  - Stand firm and be faithful and true,
  - Stand firm and be faithful and true;
  - When the enemy host is before you,
  - Stand firm and be faithful and true.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - By His power is Zion surrounded;
  - Her warriors are noble and brave,
  - And their faith on Jehovah is founded,
  - Whose power is mighty to save.
  - In each soldier a brave heart is beating,
  - Tho our numbers, compared, may be few.
  - We’ll not rest till our foes are retreating,
  - And we’ll always be faithful and true.
  - And we’ll always be faithful and true,
  - And we’ll always be faithful and true;
  - We’ll not rest till our foes are retreating,
  - And we’ll always be faithful and true.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Tho, assisted by legions infernal,
  - The plundering foemen advance,
  - With a host from the regions eternal
  - We’ll scatter their troops at a glance.
  - Soon the kingdom will be independent;
  - In wonder the nations will view
  - Our Zion in glory resplendent;
  - Then let us be faithful and true.
  - Then let us be faithful and true,
  - Then let us be faithful and true;
  - Our Zion in glory resplendent;
  - Then let us be faithful and true.
