- number: 1
  lines:
  - Let us oft speak kind words to each other
  - At home or where’er we may be;
  - Like the warblings of birds on the heather,
  - The tones will be welcome and free.
  - They’ll gladden the heart that’s repining,
  - Give courage and hope from above,
  - And where the dark clouds hide the shining,
  - Let in the bright sunlight of love.
  - Oh, the kind words we give shall in memory live
  - And sunshine forever impart.
  - Let us oft speak kind words to each other;
  - Kind words are sweet tones of the heart.

  lines:
  - Like the sunbeams of morn on the mountains,
  - The soul they awake to good cheer;
  - Like the murmur of cool, pleasant fountains,
  - They fall in sweet cadences near.
  - Let’s oft, then, in kindly toned voices,
  - Our mutual friendship renew,
  - Till heart meets with heart and rejoices
  - In friendship that ever is true.
  - Oh, the kind words we give shall in memory live
  - And sunshine forever impart.
  - Let us oft speak kind words to each other;
  - Kind words are sweet tones of the heart.
