  lines:
  - Rejoice! A glorious sound is heard
  - In triumph of the right,
  - As Zion’s youth, in league with truth,
  - Go forth in wondrous might.
  - We raise our voice in loyal shout,
  - A great exultant cry:
  - Jehovah reigns! Lord God of Hosts,
  - All hail thee, King most high.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - And down the ages, on and on,
  - Increasing ev’ry hour,
  - In loyalty and faith we go,
  - In honor, grace, and pow’r.
  - The Light of Light, God’s torch of truth,
  - As beacon points the way
  - To endless glory, kingdoms great,
  - In realms of perfect day.

  lines:
  - Arise and sing, ye sons of men;
  - All praise and honor give.
  - Arise and sing to his great name,
  - Who died that we might live.
  - On Zion’s hill, in strength and might,
  - Send forth a joyous strain;
  - In triumph over sin and strife,
  - With him in glory reign.
