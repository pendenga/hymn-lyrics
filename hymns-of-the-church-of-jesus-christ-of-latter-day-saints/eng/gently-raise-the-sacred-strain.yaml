  lines:
  - Gently raise the sacred strain,
  - For the Sabbath’s come again
  - That man may rest,
  - That man may rest,
  - And return his thanks to God
  - For his blessings to the blest,
  - For his blessings to the blest.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - Holy day, devoid of strife—
  - Let us seek eternal life,
  - That great reward,
  - That great reward,
  - And partake the sacrament
  - In remembrance of our Lord,
  - In remembrance of our Lord.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - Sweetly swells the solemn sound
  - While we bring our gifts around
  - Of broken hearts,
  - Of broken hearts,
  - As a willing sacrifice,
  - Showing what his grace imparts,
  - Showing what his grace imparts.

  lines:
  - Holy, holy is the Lord.
  - Precious, precious is his word:
  - Repent and live,
  - Repent and live;
  - Tho your sins be crimson red,
  - Oh, repent, and he’ll forgive.
  - Oh, repent, and he’ll forgive.
