verses:
- number: 1
  lines:
  - The glorious gospel light has shone
  - In this the latter day
  - With such intelligence that none
  - From truth need turn away.
  - The precious things which had been sealed
  - And from the world kept hid,
  - The Lord has to his Saints revealed
  - As anciently he did.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - And thru the priesthood now restored
  - Again prepared the way
  - Thru which the dead may hear his word
  - And all his laws obey.
  - As Christ to spirits went to preach
  - Who were to prison led,
  - So many Saints have gone to teach
  - The gospel to the dead.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - And we for them can be baptized,
  - Yes, for our friends most dear,
  - That they can with the just be raised
  - When Gabriel’s trump they hear;
  - That they may come with Christ again
  - When he to earth descends,
  - A thousand years with him to reign,
  - And with their earthly friends.
- number: 4
  lines:
  - Now, O ye Saints, rejoice today
  - That you can saviors be
  - Of all your dead who will obey
  - The gospel and be free.
  - Then let us rise without restraint
  - And act for those we love,
  - For they are giving their consent
  - And wait for us to move.
