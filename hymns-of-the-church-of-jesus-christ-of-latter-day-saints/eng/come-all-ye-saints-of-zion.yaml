  - And let us praise the Lord;

  - And thank the Lord who brought them
  - To see the latter day.

  - Come, ye dispersed of Judah,
  - Join in the theme and sing
  - With harmony unceasing
  - The praises of our King,
  - Whose arm is now extended,

  - To gather up the righteous
  - In these the latter days.

  - And let your joys abound!

  - In Zion and Jerusalem,
  - In these the latter days.

  - Then gather up for Zion,
  - Ye Saints thruout the land,
  - And clear the way before you,
  - As God shall give command.
  - Tho wicked men and devils
  - Exert their pow’r, ’tis vain,
  - Since He who is eternal
  - Has said you shall obtain.
