  - Savior, Redeemer of my soul,
  - Whose mighty hand hath made me whole,
  - Whose wondrous pow’r hath raised me up
  - And filled with sweet my bitter cup!
  - What tongue my gratitude can tell,
  - O gracious God of Israel.

  lines:
  - Never can I repay thee, Lord,
  - But I can love thee. Thy pure word,
  - Hath it not been my one delight,
  - My joy by day, my dream by night?
  - Then let my lips proclaim it still,
  - And all my life reflect thy will.

  lines:
  - O’errule mine acts to serve thine ends.
  - Change frowning foes to smiling friends.
  - Chasten my soul till I shall be
  - In perfect harmony with thee.
  - Make me more worthy of thy love,
  - And fit me for the life above.
