  - While of these emblems we partake
  - In Jesus’ name and for his sake,
  - Let us remember and be sure
  - Our hearts and hands are clean and pure.
- number: 2
  lines:
  - For us the blood of Christ was shed;
  - For us on Calvary’s cross he bled,
  - And thus dispelled the awful gloom
  - That else were this creation’s doom.
- number: 3
  lines:
  - The law was broken; Jesus died
  - That justice might be satisfied,
  - That man might not remain a slave
  - Of death, of hell, or of the grave,
- number: 4
  lines:
  - But rise triumphant from the tomb,
  - And in eternal splendor bloom,
  - Freed from the pow’r of death and pain,
  - With Christ, the Lord, to rule and reign.
