  lines:
  - They heard a voice, a voice so mild.
  - It pierced them through and made their souls to quake.
  - They saw Him come, a man in white,
  - The Savior, who had suffered for their sake.
  - They felt the wounds in hands and side,
  - And each could testify: This is the Christ.
  - This is the Christ, the holy Son of God—
  - Our Savior, Lord, Redeemer of mankind.
  - This is the Christ, the Healer of our souls,
  - Who ransomed us with love divine.

  lines:
  - I read His words, the words He prayed
  - While bearing sorrow in Gethsemane.
  - I feel His love, the price He paid.
  - How many drops of blood were spilled for me?
  - With Saints of old in joyful cry
  - I too can testify: This is the Christ.
  - This is the Christ, the holy Son of God—
  - Our Savior, Lord, Redeemer of mankind.
  - This is the Christ, the Healer of our souls,
  - Who ransomed us with love divine.
