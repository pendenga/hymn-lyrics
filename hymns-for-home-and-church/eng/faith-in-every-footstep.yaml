  lines:
  - A marvelous work has begun to come forth
  - among all the children of men.
  - O ye that embark in the service of God,
  - give heart, mind, and strength unto him;
  - For prophets have spoken and angels have come
  - to lift the world from sin,
  - That Christ may reign over all the earth
  - and bless his gathered kin.
  - With faith in ev’ry footstep,
  - we follow Christ, the Lord;
  - And filled with hope through his pure love,
  - we sing with one accord.

  lines:
  - Those marvelous Saints who embraced this great work
  - and shared it in lands far and near;
  - Who gave all their heart, mind, and strength
  - to the Lord with wisdom and vision so clear;
  - Now stand as examples of virtue and faith,
  - of souls prepared to hear,
  - Of knowledge sure, born of humble heart,
  - and love that banished fear.
  - With faith in ev’ry footstep,
  - we follow Christ, the Lord;
  - And filled with hope through his pure love,
  - we sing with one accord.

  lines:
  - If we now desire to assist in this work
  - and thrust in our sickle with might,
  - If we will embark in the service of God
  - to harvest in fields that are white;
  - Our souls may receive the salvation of God
  - the fullness of his light,
  - That we may stand, free of sin and blame,
  - God’s glory in our sight.
  - With faith in ev’ry footstep,
  - we follow Christ, the Lord;
  - And filled with hope through his pure love,
  - we sing with one accord.
